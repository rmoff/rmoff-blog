I’m writing this on my flight back from *Current 2024* in Austin.
It was a packed couple of days that you can read more about in  link:/2024/09/19/current-2024-recap/[my recap blog] .
If you want to catch the keynotes they are already online  link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sn6fVsOzrSU[day 1]  &  link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccupkhcLioM[day 2] .
I was excited to present at the conference, along with three of my colleagues, and you can find our talks here:

== Stream Processing, Streaming SQL, and Streaming Databases
* Rohan Desai, a co-founder at Responsive, has written about the new  link:https://www.responsive.dev/blog/async-processing-for-kafka-streams[Async Processor]  for Kafka Streams. It includes a useful introduction that sets the scene for why it’s needed and what the limitations of current options are.
* My former colleague Bill Bejeck has written an excellent series all about windowing in stream processing. I featured one of them previously; here’s the full set now:
* link:https://medium.com/@bbejeck/windowing-for-event-streams-80c38cc43b4d[Introduction]
* link:https://medium.com/@bbejeck/mastering-stream-processing-hopping-and-tumbling-windows-b9e685aa7a79[Hopping and tumbling windows]
* link:https://medium.com/@bbejeck/mastering-stream-processing-sliding-windows-and-over-aggregations-4c86f7034461[Sliding windows and OVER aggregations]
* link:https://medium.com/@bbejeck/mastering-stream-processing-session-and-cumulating-windows-5ed0d0822f3e[Session and cumulating windows]
* link:https://medium.com/confluent/mastering-stream-processing-time-semantics-ac5531ebd349[Time semantics]

* I wrote up a guide on  link:/2024/08/27/adventures-with-apache-flink-and-delta-lake/[how to write Delta Lake tables from Flink] , along with some troubleshooting details.


== Event Streaming
* In one of the more surprising of recent acquisitions,  link:https://www.confluent.io/blog/confluent-acquires-warpstream/[Confluent announced]  that they have acquired WarpStream to fill the Bring-Your-Own-Cloud (BYOC) gap in their portfolio. WarpStream have shot to prominence in this space for their Kafka-compatible platform which uses S3 to store data directly. WarpStream themselves are  link:https://www.warpstream.com/blog/warpstream-is-dead-long-live-warpstream[talking about]  the acquisition as an opportunity to grow further within Confluent, rather than their technology simply being absorbed into Confluent’s own. Confluent’s Jack Vanlightly took the opportunity to “clarify”  link:https://jack-vanlightly.com/blog/2024/9/11/byoc-not-the-future-of-cloud-services-but-a-pillar-of-an-everywhere-platform[his views on BYOC]  after  link:https://jack-vanlightly.com/blog/2023/9/25/on-the-future-of-cloud-services-and-byoc[being critical]  of it last year.

* Javier Holguera has published a useful set of blogs around naming conventions in Kafka, covering  link:https://javierholguera.com/2024/08/20/naming-kafka-objects-i-topics/[topics]  and  link:https://javierholguera.com/2024/09/12/naming-kafka-objects-ii-producers-and-consumers/[producers/consumers] .
* Following on from  link:https://www.uber.com/blog/kafka-tiered-storage/[Uber’s contribution]  of tiered storage for Kafka, Pinterest have shared  link:https://medium.com/pinterest-engineering/pinterest-tiered-storage-for-apache-kafka-%EF%B8%8F-a-broker-decoupled-approach-c33c69e9958b[details]  and the  link:https://github.com/pinterest/tiered-storage[source code]  (under Apache 2.0 licence) of their own implementation. It differs in several ways, including handling tiered storage separate from the broker. Pinterest having been using it in production since May this year, offloading a staggering 200 TB of data _per day_ using it.
* A useful writeup from DoorDash on how they run  link:https://doordash.engineering/2024/08/13/doordash-engineers-with-kafka-self-serve/[their internal self-service Kafka platform] .


== Data Ecosystem
* Amazon S3  link:https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/08/amazon-s3-conditional-writes/[added support]  for conditional writes which Gunnar took a look at and published this excellent post on how it could be used for  link:https://www.morling.dev/blog/leader-election-with-s3-conditional-writes/[leader election]  in distributed systems.
* Decades after the first ones were created, new databases are still being written. Learn more in  link:https://www.infoq.com/presentations/arcticdb/?utm_campaign=infoq_content&utm_source=infoq&utm_medium=feed&utm_term=AI%2C+ML+%26+Data+Engineering[this post]  about the challenges James Munro found with existing systems that led to him creating  link:https://arcticdb.io/[ArcticDB] .
* link:https://medium.com/starrocks-engineering/why-did-databricks-open-source-unity-catalog-b228bd9be367[Some observations from StarRocks]  on the Unity catalog and what the Databricks acquisition of Tabular earlier this year might mean for Apache Iceberg.
* I really enjoyed this well-written piece from Expedia detailing  link:https://medium.com/expedia-group-tech/inside-expedias-migration-to-scylladb-for-change-data-capture-706365c8e2cf[how and why they migrated from Apache Cassandra to ScyllaDB] . It includes the evaluation of the different migration options, and how they achieved a zero-downtime migration of their 15-node, 1TB Cassandra cluster.


== Data Platforms and Architecture
* Airbnb wrote about their Lambda-architecture-based platform Riverbed  link:https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/riverbed-optimizing-data-access-at-airbnbs-scale-c37ecf6456d9[last year] , and recently published a  link:https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/riverbed-data-hydration-part-1-e7011d62d946[more detailed look at it] . It’s based around  link:https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/capturing-data-evolution-in-a-service-oriented-architecture-72f7c643ee6f[their CDC solution]  which has been around for a while called  link:https://github.com/airbnb/SpinalTap[SpinalTap] .
* link:https://www.uber.com/en-GB/blog/datamesh/[This blog post]  from Uber is interesting for the level of detail it goes into in how they organize the data in their object stores to optimize for things such as data ownership, access control, throughput optimisation, and platform date limits. It’s part of  link:https://www.uber.com/blog/modernizing-ubers-data-infrastructure-with-gcp/?uclick_id=a2154eae-7b26-4a69-b64b-ec4918efb425[their move to GCP]  and migrating from HDFS to GCS.
* If you’re interested in system design you’ll want to check out this detailed  link:https://medium.com/agoda-engineering/booking-deduplication-how-agoda-manages-duplicate-bookings-across-multiple-data-centers-08ddbe9e22f1[two-part]   link:https://medium.com/agoda-engineering/booking-deduplication-how-agoda-manages-duplicate-bookings-across-multiple-data-centers-part-2-e4521c565070[series]  from Agoda that goes into the nuts-and-bolts of how they manage deduplication of bookings across multiple data centers.
* Staying with online travel booking,  link:https://medium.com/booking-com-development/the-engineering-behind-booking-coms-ranking-platform-a-system-overview-2fb222003ca6[this post from booking.com]  discusses how the ML-based ranking platform within the search results works.


== RDBMS and Change Data Capture
* Two fascinating blogs about different approaches taken to upgrading to MySQL 8.0 from  link:https://www.uber.com/en-GB/blog/upgrading-ubers-mysql-fleet/[Uber]  and  link:https://github.blog/engineering/upgrading-github-com-to-mysql-8-0/[GitHub] .
* At some point the splicing and mixing of different protocols and engines is all going to get too silly, but for now bear with me:  link:https://github.com/tansu-io/tansu[Tansu]  is a Kafka-compatible broker using Postgres as its storage, and  link:https://github.com/duckdb/pg_duckdb[pg_duckdb]  embeds DuckDB as an engine within Postgres.
* Back in the regular world of vanilla Postgres, there’s a nice collection of the  link:https://medium.com/cognite/postgres-can-do-that-f221a8046e[things you maybe didn’t realize that it could do] , along with a slightly provocative assertion that you should  link:https://mccue.dev/pages/8-16-24-just-use-postgres[just use Postgres] . The latter is actually pretty useful in positioning its strengths (and weaknesses) against other types of data management systems.


== Paper of the Month
In  link:https://www.dbtsai.com/assets/pdf/2024-Petabyte-Scale_Row-Level_Operations_in_Data_Lakehouses.pdf[Petabyte-Scale Row-Level Operations in Data Lakehouses] , Ryan Blue (one of the co-creators of Apache Iceberg) and a team from Apple look at improvements in Iceberg and Apache Spark that bring the lakehouse closer to the data warehouse of old in terms of richer functionality and performance.
