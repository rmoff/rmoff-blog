Wi-fi is now ubiquitous in most populated areas, and the way the devices communicate leaves a lot of 'digital exhaust'. Usually a computer will have a Wi-Fi device that's configured to connect to a given network, but often these devices can be configured instead to pick up the background Wi-Fi chatter of surrounding devices. 

There are good reasons—and bad—for doing this. Just like taking apart equipment to understand how it works teaches us things, so being able to https://rmoff.net/2019/11/29/using-tcpdump-with-docker/[dissect and examine protocol traffic] lets us learn about this. However, by collecting this type of traffic it can be possible to track and analyse behaviour in ways that we may or may not feel comfortable with. https://tfl.gov.uk/corporate/privacy-and-cookies/wi-fi-data-collection[Improving public transport]? Sure. https://www.theguardian.com/technology/datablog/2014/jan/10/how-tracking-customers-in-store-will-soon-be-the-norm[Tracking shopper behaviour]? Meh, less sure.

So, here's how to do it, and go ahead and make sure you're doing it for the right reasons. A plague o' your house if you don't!

== Kit list

* Raspberry Pi Model B Rev 2, 512MB, running Raspbian GNU/Linux 10 (buster)
* https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00CM83SC0/[ASUS USB-BT400 3Mbps USB Bluetooth v4.0 Mini Dongle]
* https://confluent.cloud/signup[Confluent Cloud]

I had the Raspberry Pi plugged into my network on its Ethernet port, since the Wi-Fi dongle will be otherwise occupied :) 

== Set up the wireless interface

First up, delete the existing wireless network interface that's probably there already:

{{< highlight shell >}}
sudo iw dev wlan0 del
{{< /highlight >}}

Check that that Wi-Fi physical device supports _monitor_ mode (which is what we're using), and make a note of its name (here, `phy0`): 

{{< highlight shell >}}
$ sudo iw phy
Wiphy phy0
	max # scan SSIDs: 4
	max scan IEs length: 2257 bytes
…
	Supported interface modes:
		 * IBSS
		 * managed
		 * AP
		 * AP/VLAN
		 * monitor
		 * mesh point
…         
{{< /highlight >}}

Now create a new monitoring interface (`type monitor`) bound to the physical device (`phy0`), and bring it up. 

{{< highlight shell >}}
sudo iw phy phy0 interface add mon0 type monitor
sudo ifconfig mon0 up
{{< /highlight >}}

If you check its status you should see it in monitor mode: 

{{< highlight shell >}}
$ iwconfig mon0
mon0      IEEE 802.11  Mode:Monitor  Frequency:2.417 GHz  Tx-Power=20 dBm
          Retry short  long limit:2   RTS thr:off   Fragment thr:off
          Power Management:off
{{< /highlight >}}

You should have a network config that looks something like this - a loopback (`lo`), a network connection to your LAN (`eth0`), and a monitor interface (`mon0`): 

{{< highlight shell >}}
$ ip a
1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN group default qlen 1000
    link/loopback 00:00:00:00:00:00 brd 00:00:00:00:00:00

       valid_lft 7158sec preferred_lft 7158sec
    inet6 fe80::8b6b:8c75:94a0:1aac/64 scope link
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
4: mon0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,PROMISC,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc mq state UNKNOWN group default qlen 1000
    link/ieee802.11/radiotap 00:0f:60:04:ef:a4 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
{{< /highlight >}}

== Here comes the tools

Let's install some useful things: 

{{< highlight shell >}}
sudo apt-get install -y tcpdump tshark jq kafkacat
{{< /highlight >}}

Check everything's working by running `tcpdump` to dump out the Wi-Fi traffic as it's received: 

{{< highlight shell >}}
$ sudo tcpdump -i mon0 -n
tcpdump: verbose output suppressed, use -v or -vv for full protocol decode

There's five packets of real live Wi-Fi data! And there's a bunch you can do with `tcpdump` and filters etc, but because we want this data out in a structured manner (i.e. key/values) I'm going to cut over to `tshark` now. 

`tshark` is the CLI companion to the well known network tool, Wireshark. You can use it standalone, or you can even use it as a source for Wireshark - which is pretty cool. 

Let's start with a quick `tshark`: 

{{< highlight shell >}}
$ sudo tshark -i mon0
Running as user "root" and group "root". This could be dangerous.
Capturing on 'mon0'
    1 0.000000000 Apple_17:17:d3 → Broadcast    802.11 175 Probe Request, SN=672, FN=0, Flags=........, SSID=RNM0
    2 0.009712480 Apple_17:17:d3 → Broadcast    802.11 175 Probe Request, SN=673, FN=0, Flags=........, SSID=RNM0
    3 20.711944424 66:9f:b3:xx:xx:xx → Broadcast    802.11 106 Probe Request, SN=772, FN=0, Flags=........, SSID=Wildcard (Broadcast)
    4 20.719399794              → Bskyb_13:16:82 (3c:89:94:xx:xx:xx) (RA) 802.11 28 Acknowledgement, Flags=........
{{< /highlight >}}

There's that Wi-Fi data again! 

But how to get this data out in a truly structured way that's going to be useful in subsequent processing? 

== Writing structured JSON from `tshark`

As you can see from above `tshark` by default writes data in a loosely-structured way that would be impossible to parse programatically. We want a structured format such as JSON, and that's _kind of_ possible with the `-T` flag and `ek` argument: 

{{< highlight shell >}}
$ sudo tshark -i mon0 -T ek
Running as user "root" and group "root". This could be dangerous.
Capturing on 'mon0'

{{< /highlight >}}

There's a couple of points to deal with here. The first is that for each packet there are _two_ rows emitted; an index header for Elasticsearch (since `ek` is designed for ingest into it), and then the _full_ payload. We don't want the whole payload but just a few columns. We can use the `-e` parameter to specify the fields that we're interested in, and a simple `grep` to drop the Elasticsearch header message. I've also added `-l` to stop the output being buffered: 

{{< highlight shell >}}
$ sudo tshark -i mon0 \
            -T ek \
            -l \
            -e wlan.fc.type \
            -e wlan.fc.type_subtype \
            -e wlan_radio.channel | \
        grep timestamp
{{< /highlight >}}

{{< highlight javascript >}}
{"timestamp" : "1583923966878", "layers" : {"wlan_fc_type": ["1"],"wlan_fc_type_subtype": ["27"],"wlan_radio_channel": ["2"]}}
{"timestamp" : "1583923967196", "layers" : {"wlan_fc_type": ["1"],"wlan_fc_type_subtype": ["27"],"wlan_radio_channel": ["2"]}}
{"timestamp" : "1583923967296", "layers" : {"wlan_fc_type": ["1"],"wlan_fc_type_subtype": ["27"],"wlan_radio_channel": ["2"]}}
{{< /highlight >}}

This is starting to look rather useful. Let's add in a bit of `jq` magic to merge the `timestamp` field in with the rest of the payload which we'll pull up to the root level: 

{{< highlight shell >}}
$ sudo tshark -i mon0 \
            -T ek \
            -l \
            -e wlan.fc.type \
            -e wlan.fc.type_subtype \
            -e wlan_radio.channel | \
        grep timestamp | \
        jq --unbuffered -c '{timestamp: .timestamp} + .layers' 
{{< /highlight >}}

{{< highlight javascript >}}
{"timestamp":"1583924233530","wlan_fc_type":["0"],"wlan_fc_type_subtype":["4"],"wlan_radio_channel":["2"]}
{"timestamp":"1583924235474","wlan_fc_type":["1"],"wlan_fc_type_subtype":["25"],"wlan_radio_channel":["2"]}
{"timestamp":"1583924235613","wlan_fc_type":["1"],"wlan_fc_type_subtype":["25"],"wlan_radio_channel":["2"]}
{{< /highlight >}}

== Streaming Wi-Fi data into Apache Kafka

Now, let's stream this data into Kafka. Once it's in Kafka we can use it for lots of things! We can use Kafka Connect to stream it onwards to places like Elasticsearch, Neo4j, S3. We can write ksqlDB applications to analyse and aggregate it. We can use it to drive services that subscribe to a stream of Wi-Fi data. The world will be our oyster!

Instead of the faff of running Kafka for myself I'm using Confluent Cloud. Its https://www.confluent.io/confluent-cloud-faqs/#how-is-pricing-calculated-for-confluent-cloud[pricing] is such that you just pay for the data you use, making it very cheap to start playing around with, especially with the current $50 credit per month for first three months offer. https://confluent.cloud/signup[Sign up] and create your cluster and get your API key and broker details. 

Create a file with your Confluent Cloud details in: 

{{< highlight shell >}}
$ cat .env
CCLOUD_BROKER_HOST=foo-bar.us-central1.gcp.confluent.cloud
CCLOUD_API_KEY=XXXXXXXXXXX
CCLOUD_API_SECRET=YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
{{< /highlight >}}

We installed `kafkacat` above, and can now use it to connect to our cloud environment. The `-L` argument tells `kafkacat` to do a metadata query across the brokers and topics: 

{{< highlight shell >}}
$ source .env
$ kafkacat -X security.protocol=SASL_SSL -X sasl.mechanisms=PLAIN -X api.version.request=true \
            -b ${CCLOUD_BROKER_HOST}:9092 \
            -X sasl.username="${CCLOUD_API_KEY}" \
            -X sasl.password="${CCLOUD_API_SECRET}" \
            -L
{{< /highlight >}}

{{< highlight shell >}}
Metadata for all topics (from broker -1: sasl_ssl://foobar.us-central1.gcp.confluent.cloud:9092/bootstrap):
 18 brokers:
  broker 0 at b0-foobar.us-central1.gcp.confluent.cloud:9092
  broker 5 at b5-foobar.us-central1.gcp.confluent.cloud:9092
  broker 10 at b10-foobar.us-central1.gcp.confluent.cloud:9092
  broker 15 at b15-foobar.us-central1.gcp.confluent.cloud:9092
  broker 9 at b9-foobar.us-central1.gcp.confluent.cloud:9092
…
 8 topics:
  topic "wibble" with 6 partitions:
    partition 0, leader 13, replicas: 13,2,5, isrs: 13,2,5
    partition 1, leader 14, replicas: 14,6,7, isrs: 14,6,7
…    
{{< /highlight >}}

Now that this is working, go ahead and create a topic called `pcap`, either through the Confluent Cloud web UI or the command line tool. It's important that you create this topic, as auto-topic creation is not enabled on Confluent Cloud. 

With the topic created, let's populate it! We are going to hook up the output from `tshark` in the previous section with the mighty power of `kafkacat` courtesy of unix pipes:

{{< highlight shell >}}
sudo tshark -i mon0 \
            -T ek \
            -l \
            -e wlan.fc.type -e wlan.fc.type_subtype -e wlan_radio.channel \
            -e wlan_radio.signal_dbm -e wlan_radio.duration -e wlan.ra \
            -e wlan.ra_resolved -e wlan.da -e wlan.da_resolved \
            -e wlan.ta -e wlan.ta_resolved -e wlan.sa \
            -e wlan.sa_resolved -e wlan.staa -e wlan.staa_resolved \
            -e wlan.tagged.all -e wlan.tag.vendor.data -e wlan.tag.vendor.oui.type \
            -e wlan.tag.oui -e wlan.ssid -e wlan.country_info.code \
            -e wps.device_name |\
    grep timestamp|\
    jq -c '{timestamp: .timestamp} + .layers' |\
    kafkacat -X security.protocol=SASL_SSL -X sasl.mechanisms=PLAIN -X api.version.request=true\
            -b ${CCLOUD_BROKER_HOST}:9092 \
            -X sasl.username="${CCLOUD_API_KEY}" \
            -X sasl.password="${CCLOUD_API_SECRET}" \
            -P \
            -t pcap \
            -T
{{< /highlight >}}

A few notes about what's going on here. We've added in a bunch more fields from the Wi-Fi payload to capture in `tshark`. We're also specifying `-P` to tell `kafkacat` to act as producer, `-t` to specify the topic, and `-T` to echo the messages to stdout as well as write them to the topic (just like `tee` does). 

With this running you'll see the messages arriving in the topic, either through `kafkacat` run as a producer: 

{{< highlight shell >}}
$ kafkacat -X security.protocol=SASL_SSL -X sasl.mechanisms=PLAIN -X api.version.request=true \
           -b ${CCLOUD_BROKER_HOST}:9092 \
           -X sasl.username="${CCLOUD_API_KEY}" -X sasl.password="${CCLOUD_API_SECRET}" \
           -C -t pcap

== What's next?

So now we've got the data streaming into Kafka, what's next? Well, how about some https://ksqldb.io/[ksqlDB] to analyse it:
