I followed the [**First Steps** quickstart from the Flink docs](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-1.17/docs/try-flink/local_installation/) which is a nicely-paced walk through: 

0Ô∏è‚É£ make sure you've got Java 11

1Ô∏è‚É£ install Flink ([download](https://flink.apache.org/downloads/), unpack (with a [little detour](/2023/10/04/cd-string-not-in-pwd/)))

2Ô∏è‚É£ run it (`./bin/start-cluster.sh`)

3Ô∏è‚É£ submit the sample WordCount app

4Ô∏è‚É£ see the execution in the web UI

5Ô∏è‚É£ examine the output

The WebUI is a nice touch - sometimes just running everything on the CLI gives you a technically correct finish but if you're new to something leaves you underwhelmed. The webUI lets you click around a bit and start to get a feel for what's going on.

You can find the source for the WordCount app [here](https://github.com/apache/flink/blob/release-1.17/flink-examples/flink-examples-batch/src/main/java/org/apache/flink/examples/java/wordcount/WordCount.java), and further tutorials on Flink [here](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-1.17/docs/try-flink/local_installation/).
