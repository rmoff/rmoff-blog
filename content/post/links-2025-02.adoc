Here's a bunch of interesting links and articles about data that I've come across recently.

<!--more-->

* Martin Kleppmanm's seminal talk from 2015, https://martin.kleppmann.com/2015/11/05/database-inside-out-at-oredev.html[Turning the database inside out] came up on my feed recently, and is still such an important work.
* Going back even further, check out the https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/800296.811515[original SQL paper, from 1974].
* Not only do I love the clever title, but https://www.infoq.com/articles/rethinking-medallion-architecture/[The End of the Bronze Age: Rethinking the Medallion Architecture] is also a really good explanation of how "shift left" applies in the data world. If you prefer video there's https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FiZmyl1Npg0[one of those too].
* An https://www.streamingdata.tech/p/interview-with-nikhil-benesch-materialize[interesting interview] from a while back with Materialize's CTO, Nikhil Benesch. 
* A useful look at the practicalities of https://www.confluent.io/en-gb/blog/implementing-streaming-data-products/[Data Products, Data Contracts, and Change Data Capture].
* I recently came across an interesting project from the European Union called https://big-data-test-infrastructure.ec.europa.eu/index_en[Big Data Test Infrastructure]. Despite the slightyly old-fashioned name, they're doing some cool stuff with data and public services, such as this one looking at  https://big-data-test-infrastructure.ec.europa.eu/whats-new/news/rooting-data-revolutionising-urban-tree-health-monitoring-bochum-germany-2024-11-27_en[tree health in a town in Germany].
* DataDog have their own proprietary https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/engineering/introducing-husky/[event storage system called Husky]. They've previously shared details of the https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/engineering/husky-deep-dive/[ingestion process], and have recently posted how https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/engineering/husky-storage-compaction/[data compaction at scale is handled].
* Two Apache projects were https://news.apache.org/foundation/entry/the-apache-software-foundation-announces-new-top-level-projects[recently announced] as graduating to top-level projects, including https://streampark.apache.org/[Apache StreamPark].
* Excellent analysis from Jack Vanlightly looking at https://jack-vanlightly.com/blog/2025/2/3/why-snowflake-wants-streaming[Why Snowflake wants streaming] (specifically, Redpanda, about whom acquisition rumours are swirling).
* A new Kafka TUI called https://github.com/dhth/kplay[kplay], and GUI called https://kafkio.com/features[KafkIO].
* What better way to learn the low-level details of Kafka than https://www.reddit.com/r/apachekafka/comments/1hnkrzi/monkafka_building_a_kafka_broker_from_scratch/[writing your own broker]…
* Confluent recently launched https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=confluentinc.vscode-confluent[a VSCode plugin] which now https://old.reddit.com/r/apachekafka/comments/1hfr68m/the_confluent_extension_for_vs_code_now_supports/[supports Kafka clusters too] (not just Confluent Cloud).

* https://github.com/hyprstream/hyprstream[Hyprstream] is a built on Apache Arrow Flight and DuckDB for "real-time data ingestion, windowed aggregation, caching, and serving". Read the associated paper https://github.com/hyprstream/hyprstream?tab=readme-ov-file[here].
* https://renegadeotter.com/2023/11/12/your-database-skills-are-not-good-to-have.html[Your Database Skills Are Not 'Good to Have']
