This is revisiting https://rmoff.net/2018/03/27/cloning-ubiquitis-mongodb-instance-to-a-separate-server/[the blog I wrote a while back], which showed using `mongodump` and `mongorestore` to copy a MongoDB database from one machine (a Unifi CloudKey) to another. This time instead of a manual lift and shift, I wanted a simple way to automate the update of the target with changes made on the source. 

The source is as before, https://www.ui.com/unifi/unifi-cloud-key/[Unifi's CloudKey], which runs MongoDB to store its data about the network - devices, access points, events, and so on. 

== Why?

So that I can get this interesting data from somewhere that I cannot mess with into a place from which I can easily stream it into Kafka. 

== The constraints

* Unifi uses MongoDB **v2.4.10** which is pretty darn old
* I must not break the source - it runs my home network and my kids will be mad if it stops working just so that I can hack around on it. I want the least-impact option, and I definitely don't want to start reconfiguring MongoDB with replicas and stuff like that
* My target MongoDB is running in Docker

== The solution

It's as hacky as they come. Instead of `mongodump` to a file which I then copy to the target and repopulate with `mongorestore`, I use Linux pipes and remote command execution with SSH to stream the dump from the source directly into the target. 

First bring up a MongoDB container: 

{{< highlight shell >}}
docker run --rm \
           --publish 27017 \
           --name mongodb \
           mongo:4.2.2
{{< /highlight >}}

Then copy across the data: 

{{< highlight shell >}}
ssh robin@unifi \
    mongodump --port 27117 --db=ace --collection=device --out=- | \
docker exec --interactive mongodb \
    mongorestore --dir=- --db=ace --collection=device
{{< /highlight >}}

In detail: 

* `ssh robin@unifi` connects remotely to the Unifi cloudkey server (using existing https://www.rittmanmead.com/blog/2014/12/linux-cluster-sysadmin-ssh-keys/[SSH keys] for password-less authentication)
* `\` is the line continuation character just to make all of this easier to read
* `mongodump` is called and the important point here is that I specify `--out=-` which instead of dumping to file dumps to `stdout`
* `|` the magic pipe! This routes the `stdout` from `mongodump` into…
* `docker exec` runs the following command on the MongoDB container. Because I specify the `--interactive` argument it passes the stdout of the previous step as `stdin` into…
* `mongorestore` which reads from `stdin` because I've specified `--dir=-`

The rest of the parameters are just specifying the database and collection that I want to copy. When this runs you can see the documents get created: 

{{< highlight shell >}}

If you re-run it you just get duplicate key violations, which is to be expected, and means that in theory I can just rerun this process on a timed loop and pick up any new documents whilst ignoring existing ones. Not very efficient, but fairly effective :)

== Iterating across collections

Because we're using stdout/stdin we have to specify the database and collection. To loop over them you can just use a https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/bash-for-loop/[for loop in bash]: 

{{< highlight shell >}}
for c in collection_foo collection_bar
do
    ssh robin@unifi \
        mongodump --port 27117 --db=ace --collection=$c --out=- | \
    docker exec --interactive mongodb \
        mongorestore --dir=- --db=ace --collection=$c
done
{{< /highlight >}}

This will run the same import/export for `collection_foo` and `collection_bar`.
