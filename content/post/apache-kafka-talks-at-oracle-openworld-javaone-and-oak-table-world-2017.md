There's an impressive 19 sessions that cover Apache Kafka™ at Oracle OpenWorld, JavaOne, and Oak Table World this year! You can find the full list with speakers in the session catalogs for [OOW](https://events.rainfocus.com/catalog/oracle/oow17/catalogoow17?search=kafka&showEnrolled=false), [JavaOne](https://events.rainfocus.com/catalog/oracle/oow17/catalogjavaone17?search=kafka&showEnrolled=false), and [Oak Table World](http://www.oaktable.net/blog/oak-table-world-2017-oracle-open-world). OTW is an awesome techie conference which is at the same time as OpenWorld, next door to Moscone. Hope to see you there!
