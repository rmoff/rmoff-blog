Having written my first link:/2020/07/08/learning-golang-some-rough-notes-s02e01-my-first-kafka-go-producer/[Kafka producer in Go], and even link:/2020/07/10/learning-golang-some-rough-notes-s02e02-adding-error-handling-to-the-producer/[added error handling to it], the next step was to write a consumer. It follows closely the pattern of link:/2020/07/10/learning-golang-some-rough-notes-s02e02-adding-error-handling-to-the-producer/[Producer code I finished up with previously], using the channel-based approach for the https://docs.confluent.io/current/clients/confluent-kafka-go/index.html#Consumer[Consumer]:  

<!--more-->

* Create Consumer
* Subscribe to topic
* Read messages from the channel as the consumer receives them
* When we've read all messages, exit

NOTE: I've used the channel-based consumer because it fitted the most neatly with my existing code that I was adapting to work as a consumer, and the general concept of consuming from a channel also felt quite idiomatic. _However_, if you consult the https://github.com/confluentinc/confluent-kafka-go#channel-based-consumer-deprecated[client GitHub repo] you'll see that the channel-based consumer is marked as deprecated, and there is a https://github.com/confluentinc/confluent-kafka-go/blob/e266799b3bfbbaf8230a9a6f71e8c92f0e67341b/kafka/consumer.go#L369-L374[note in the code] as to why this is. I'll take a look in the next article at using the function-based consumer instead :)

The main thing here is that we use the `.Events()` channel for which there's a Go Routine, and so this pattern to wait until we've finished with it:

[source,go]
----
// For signalling termination from main to go-routine
termChan := make(chan bool, 1)
// For signalling that termination is done from go-routine to main
doneChan := make(chan bool)

go func() {
    doTerm := false
    for !doTerm {
        select {

            // channels that we're listening to

        case <-termChan:
            doTerm = true
        }
    }

    close(doneChan)
}()

// â€¦ 

// We're ready to finish
termChan <- true
// wait for go-routine to terminate
<-doneChan
// Now we can exit
p.Close()
----

To know when to finish, we listen for `PartitionEOF` events, which we need to enable when creating the consumer

[source,go]
----
"enable.partition.eof":     true
----

When we receive one we'll assume there's just the single partition (BIG assumption) and set the `doTerm` to true to break out of the `for` loop in the Go routine which then closes the `doneChan` and the program can exit

[source,go]
----
case kafka.PartitionEOF:
    // We've finished reading messages on this partition so let's wrap up
    pe := ev.(kafka.PartitionEOF)
    fmt.Printf("ðŸŒ† Got to the end of partition %v on topic %v at offset %v\n",
        pe.Partition,
        string(*pe.Topic),
        pe.Offset)
    termChan <- true
----

The full code looks like this: 

[source,go]
----
include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rmoff/rmoff-blog/master/content/code/go/kafka/consumer01/consumer01.go[]
----

I run it using a link:/code/go/kafka/consumer01/docker-compose.yml[Docker Compose] which also runs a data generator in Kafka Connect populating a topic for the consumer to read from. When I shut down Kafka Connect the data generator stops, the consumer reads to the end of the topic, and exits:
