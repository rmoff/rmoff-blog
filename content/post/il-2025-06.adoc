== Open Table Formats / Data Lakehouses

* 🔥 Instead of enthusiastically hopping on the Iceberg bandwagon with both webbed feet, DuckDB Labs have been quietly building their own format.
https://ducklake.select/[DuckLake] was https://ducklake.select/manifesto/[announced] at the beginning of the month, and is a replacement for _both_ an OTF such as Iceberg _and_ the metadata catalog that an OTF user will invariably need to wire up too.
I had a link:/2025/06/02/digging-into-ducklake/[quick poke around it], and https://tobilg.com/the-age-of-10-dollar-a-month-lakehouses[Tobias Müller] and https://medium.com/@mcgeehan/quacks-stacks-5565069a5ef0[Thomas F McGeehan V] both went into it in more detail, along with https://motherduck.com/blog/ducklake-motherduck/[MotherDuck] who'll unsurprisingly be offering it as a managed service.

* The catalog space is a vital one for OTFs, and there are various projects springing up alongside the more established Unity and Polaris catalogs.
Some do slightly different things (such as management e.g. compaction) or have a broader ambition (cataloging _all_ your data, not just OTF):

** https://github.com/nimtable/nimtable[nimtable] (from RisingWave)
** https://github.com/apache/gravitino[apache/gravitino]

* I've written about writing to Iceberg from Kafka with Flink https://www.decodable.co/blog/kafka-to-iceberg-with-flink[before], but shipped link:/2025/06/24/writing-to-apache-iceberg-on-s3-using-flink-sql-with-glue-catalog/[a new blog this week] that throws AWS Glue Data Catalog into the mix.

* Some useful points to think about from Jacek Migdal covering where https://quesma.com/blog-detail/apache-iceberg-practical-limitations-2025[Iceberg might not be the right fit for your requirements]
