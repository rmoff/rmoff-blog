At this year's Kafka Summit I'm planning to continue the tradition of going for a run (or walk) with anyone who'd like to join in. This started back at Kafka Summit San Francisco in 2019 https://twitter.com/rmoff/status/1179047181891883008[over the Golden Gate Bridge] and has continued since then. Whilst London's Docklands might not offer _quite_ the same experience it'll be fun nonetheless.

== Who? What? Where? When? 

* _Who_:  Anyone who would like to is very welcome :) 
* _What_: A 5k (3.1 miles) run or walk
* _Where_: Starting from the Aloft Hotel (next to the ExCeL center), heading up to Beckton Park and taking in some of the Parkrun route.
* _When_: **Tuesday 19th March**. 

We'll **meet at 07:00 GMT** in the carpark in front of the hotel. That'll give us time to congregate and take some https://twitter.com/search?q=%23streamingselfie%20%23kafkasummit%20until%3A2020-03-01&src=typed_query&f=live[`#streamingselfie`]s if you want them, before setting off at 07:10 sharp to make our way around the https://www.strava.com/clubs/1039355/group_events/1146993[the 5k route].

Go at your own pace; this isn't a race. You can run, or walk. Or skip, if you prefer. You can https://strava.app.link/IjwMA4dI4Hb[download the route] to follow at your leisure. In fact, it's a good idea to do so because this is not an organised event, so it's your responsibility not to get lost :-D

If you Strava, feel free to join the https://www.strava.com/clubs/1039355[Strava Club].

== Cool, where do I register? 

Register at `/dev/null` ;-) 

This is an entirely unofficial, barely-organised, thing. Turn up and run, if you want. Don't, if you don't. Fully intend to but sleep in from the jetlag and miss it, that's completely fine 😁
