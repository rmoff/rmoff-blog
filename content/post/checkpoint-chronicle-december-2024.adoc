== Stream Processing, Streaming SQL, and Streaming Databases
* As featured in October’s Checkpoint Chronicle, Ververica recently  link:https://www.ververica.com/blog/introducing-fluss[announced]  Fluss—a streaming storage engine. It’s now been  link:https://github.com/alibaba/fluss[released under Apache 2.0 licence] , and Yaroslav Tkachenko has  link:https://www.streamingdata.tech/p/fluss-first-impression[taken it for a spin] .
* link:https://en.oceanbase.com/blog/14362521600[Interesting details]  of how the Chinese logistics provider KYE evaluated different stream processing engines and databases to settle on Apache Flink and OceanBase.
* ChunTing Wu  link:https://dev.to/lazypro/apache-paimon-playground-ft-flink-and-trino-10fo[writes up]  their experience trying out Apache Paimon with Flink, Trino, and StarRocks (and helpfully  link:https://github.com/wirelessr/paimon-trino-flink-playground[shares the Docker Compose]  so you can try it too)
* A useful peek from Lenon Rodrigues under the covers of Flink looking at  link:https://medium.com/@lenonrodrigues/data-transfer-in-apache-flink-a-comprehensive-overview-fe9dbfa99781[how and when data transfer occurs between the different processes] .


== Event Streaming
* Excellent research and analysis from RedMonk’s Kate Holterhoff in  link:https://redmonk.com/kholterhoff/2024/12/12/why-message-queues-endure-a-history/[Why Message Queues Endure: A History]
* Strimzi 0.44 added  link:https://strimzi.io/blog/2024/11/25/autorebalancing-on-scaling/[auto-rebalancing on cluster scaling] —this article from Paolo Patierno has a good overview of how to use it. If you want to know more also check out this KubeCon NA 2024  link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pj6eLTC2tv8[conference talk]  from Jakub Scholz.
* link:https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-853%3A+KRaft+Controller+Membership+Changes[KIP-853]  added dynamic controller quorum to Kafka in 3.9— link:https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2024/11/27/dynamic-kafka-controller-quorum[this article]  from Federico Valeri and Luke Chen at RedHat explains how KRaft clusters can now scale controller nodes without downtime.
* An excellent exploration of  link:https://cefboud.github.io/posts/exploring-kafka-internals/[Apache Kafka Internals]  from Moncef Abboud. I love this kind of approach to learning more about a technology—writing about it in public is not only a great way to improve one’s own understanding, but to help others too.
* link:https://github.com/vordimous/gohlay[Gohlay]  is a tool for Kafka for scheduling messages. I was pretty intrigued by it, and its author gave some really useful background about it in  link:https://old.reddit.com/r/apachekafka/comments/1h4vt36/i_built_a_kafka_message_scheduling_tool/m01sbc7/[this Reddit post] .
* Apache Kafka 4.0 is scheduled for release late January/early February, and the feature freeze just passed. One of the most significant changes is the removal of ZooKeeper and marking KRaft as production ready ( link:https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-833%3A+Mark+KRaft+as+Production+Ready[KIP-833] ). You can find the  link:https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/Release+Plan+4.0.0[release plan here] , and also see a list of  link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-18224?jql=project%20%3D%20KAFKA%20AND%20fixVersion%20%3D%204.0.0[included JIRAs] .


== Data Ecosystem
* A detailed and thorough exploration and evaluation of the  link:https://www.onehouse.ai/blog/comprehensive-data-catalog-comparison[different types of Data Catalog and their implementations]  from OneHouse’s Kyle Weller. This is a really messy space and I’m looking forward to when we have the kind of relatively stable state that we now have around the open table formats (OTF).
* For data engineers one of the biggest bits of news from AWS re:Invent last week was the launch of  link:https://aws.amazon.com/s3/features/tables/[Amazon S3 Tables]  which hold Apache Iceberg data in a dedicated S3 bucket type. There’s been a fair bit written about them, including simple explanations, hands-on, and analysis:some text

== Data Platforms and Architecture
* I enjoyed  link:https://hex.tech/blog/rebuilding-data-warehouse-with-blue-green-deployment/[this honest writeup from Hex]  of how a data warehouse got into a bit of a mess over time, and how they rectified it with no downtime to end users.
* If you like database internals you’ll definitely want to read  link:https://medium.com/@adamprout/categorizing-how-distributed-databases-utilize-consensus-algorithms-492c8ff9e916[this post]  from Adam Prout in which he categorises the different types of consensus algorithms that distributed databases use.
* I’m a big fan of graph technology and thoroughly enjoyed this account of  link:https://medium.com/booking-com-development/leverage-graph-technology-for-real-time-fraud-detection-and-prevention-438336076ea5[how Booking.com use it to detect fraud in real-time] .
* Details from Prabodh Agarwal of how Toplyne are  link:https://substack.com/@pbd1194/p-145894594[building a data lakehouse using Kafka and Apache Hudi] , including why they chose Hudi over Iceberg and Delta Lake.


== RDBMS and Change Data Capture
