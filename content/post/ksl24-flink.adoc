This year Kafka Summit London includes a dedicated track for talks about Apache Flink. This reflects the continued rise of interest and use of Apache Flink in the streaming community, as well as the focus that Confluent (the hosts of Kafka Summit) has on it.

I'm looking forward to being back at Kafka Summit. I will be speaking on Tuesday afternoon, room hosting on Wednesday morning, and hanging out at https://www.decodable.co/blog/meet-decodable-at-kafka-summit-london-2024[the Decodable booth] in between too.

Here's a list of all the Flink talks, including the talk, time, and speaker. You find find more details, and the full Kafka Summit agenda, https://events.bizzabo.com/559905/agenda[here].
