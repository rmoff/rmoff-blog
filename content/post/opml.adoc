I do my best to try and keep, if not abreast of, then at least aware of what's going on in the world of data. That includes RDBMS, Event streaming, stream processing, open source data projects, data engineering, object storage, and more. If you're interested in the same, then you might find this blog useful, because I'm sharing my sources :)

== Sidenote: allow me some nostalgia

In the https://rnm1978.wordpress.com/2009/03/[_really_ old days] not that many people blogged. It was kinda weird. There'd be a handful of folk in your circle of interest who also blogged, and you'd maybe have a _Blogroll_ linking out to their blogs and/or feeds.

In the old days, a bit after that, more people started blogging, and one had to be organised about following what was written. The fantastic technology that is RSS came about. I used Google Reader (RIP) and followed a ton of blogs. Then Google Reader was infamously killed off, and I switched to Feedly. Then I‚Ä¶dunno. I moved jobs, I didn't have time, I made excuses, whatever. I stopped following blogs so closely, and instead got my current tech news from Twitter and from colleagues. This was all about seven years ago, and I even link:/2017/03/11/keeping-up-with-the-deluge/[wrote about it].

In that time, probably around the late 2010's, RSS started to fade. `<RANT>` _This is to my eternal horror, and an illustration of the enshittification of the internet. Instead of having an easy way to share material openly using an standard and open format that people could consume with whatever platform or tool they wanted, a bunch of smart people wanting to make money off other people's content decided it was far more sensible to put up walls. Instead of being able to pull a set of RSS feeds into one place, the reader would instead traipse around numerous platforms to read the material there. Eyeballs, amirite? That, plus a lively tech twitter scene and some clever algorithms meant that folk got their fill of tech news directly. It might have been from blogs, but often direct linked instead of from an RSS feed being followed._ `</RANT>`

Fast-forward to today, and I'm back with a centrally managed RSS feed‚Äîand it's working great üòÉ

== RSS is dead‚Ä¶long live RSS! (_All Hail Inoreader_)

I'm using an excellent RSS reader called https://www.inoreader.com[Inoreader]. I spent a bunch of time last year looking at options and settled on this one. It's got some really nice features on top of simply collecting RSS feeds and organising them into folders including:

* Web scraping for blogs that don't offer RSS (grrrr)‚Äîusually does a half decent job of telling you when there's a new article to read
* Newsletter subscriptions (get a bespoke email; newsletters sent to that address show up in your feed)
* Share articles to lots of services plus custom integrations
* Search across feeds
* Feed filters and rules
* Create custom RSS feeds from your folders
* Load full content (even if the payload isn't in the RSS feed itself)

There's a free plan‚ÄîI pay for the pro one because it's worth it and I like supporting good projects.

== So‚Ä¶where are these blogs then?

**Here's the OPML for link:/code/rmoff-opml-2024-05-22.xml[all the blogs that I follow at the moment]. They're live links so should reflect my current subscriptions, not just as they were when I wrote this article**.

My RSS feeds are skewed towards my interest in the data industry‚Äîstreaming, analytics, data engineering, RDBMS. And just to make it fun it's got some general tech feeds (HackerNews, Lobste.rs), some podcasts, and some running blogs too. Cos, it's mine and I curate it :-P

The feeds are split into folders of roughly logical grouping. I've shared each one below as individual OPML‚Äîbut if you want to follow along dynamically as I add (or remove) feeds from these folders, you can use the RSS feed of each.

There is also a web page view (HTML) of each folder too.
