After some changes on my Mac (maybe OS upgrade - not sure) my local install of Hugo stopped working. Recording the errors and steps I took (random jiggling to unbreak things) to help others in case it helps.

The repeated errors I got were:

Ignoring eventmachine-1.2.7 because its extensions are not built. Try: gem pristine eventmachine --version 1.2.7

## Fix

NOTE: I am not a Ruby guy and don't have a clue what these errors actually mean! If there is a better or more accurate way to fix them please do https://twitter.com/rmoff/[contact me on Twitter] and I'll update this blog :) 

I ran several things, and what I *think* fixed it was: 

1. Installed XCode from the app store. It _was_ installed previously, don't know why it wasn't any more (OS upgrade maybe?).
2. Run `sudo xcodebuild -license` and scroll down and type `accept`. I didn't do this step at first and you do need to
3. For each of the `gem` errors, run the suggested `gem pristine` command, with `sudo`:

[source,bash]

sudo gem pristine posix-spawn --version 0.3.13
sudo gem pristine ruby-debug-ide --version 0.6.0
â€¦etc

4. I also ran a `brew install ruby` - I don't know if this helped or not.
