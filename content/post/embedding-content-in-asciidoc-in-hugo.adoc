I use https://gohugo.io/[Hugo] for my blog, hosted on GitHub pages. One of the reasons I'm really happy with it is that I can use Asciidoc to author my posts. I was writing a blog recently in which I wanted to include some code that's hosted on GitHub. I could have copied & pasted it into the blog but that would be lame! 

With Asciidoc you can use the `include::` directive to include both local files: 

[listing]
----
    include::/tmp/go_routine_errors.go[]
----

as well as external URIs:

[listing]
----
    include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/confluentinc/demo-scene/master/pipeline-to-the-cloud/data/mssql/b00_create_db_demo.sql[]
----

Note that you can also use source code formatting for these included files: 

[listing]
----
    [source,go]
    ----
    include::/tmp/go_routine_errors.go[]
    ----
----

For content from URIs you need to make sure that the security permissions are set when Asciidoctor is invoked, https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#include-uri[detailed here].

For using it from Hugo you need to do two things:

1. make sure you're on a recent version (I was on 0.54 and scratching my head until I upgraded to v0.75) 
2. add to your site configuration the necessary security permissions to be passed to asciidoctor: 
+
[source,yaml]
