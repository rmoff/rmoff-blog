_The problem with publishing link:/2025/02/03/interesting-links-february-2025/[February's interesting links] at the beginning of the month and now getting around to publishing March's at the end is that I have nearly two months' worth of links to share 😅 So with no further ado, let's crack on._

include::../../asciidoc-includes/il-header.adoc[]

== DuckDB

* I've been using DuckDB a lot recently and wrote up a few articles:
** link:/2025/03/20/building-a-data-pipeline-with-duckdb/[Building a Data Pipeline with DuckDB]
** link:/2025/02/27/duckdb-tricks-renaming-fields-in-a-select-across-tables/[DuckDB Tricks: Renaming Fields in a SELECT * across tables]
** link:/2025/02/28/exploring-uk-environment-agency-data-in-duckdb-and-rill/[Exploring UK Environment Agency Data in DuckDB and Rill]
* The https://duckdb.org/2025/03/12/duckdb-ui.html[release of a built-in UI] got the DuckDB community a flappin' and quackin'. I wrote two blog posts about it:
** link:/2025/03/14/kicking-the-tyres-on-the-new-duckdb-ui/[Kicking the Tyres on the New DuckDB UI]
** link:/2025/03/19/exporting-notebooks-from-duckdb-ui/[Exporting Notebooks from DuckDB UI]
* DuckDB also https://duckdb.org/2025/03/14/preview-amazon-s3-tables.html[added support] for reading from https://aws.amazon.com/s3/features/tables/[Amazon S3 Tables] (Amazon's managed Apache Iceberg offering).
* Tobias Müller has started a https://learningduckdb.com/newsletters/welcome-to-learning-duckdb/[Learning DuckDB newsletter]
* DeepSeek released https://github.com/deepseek-ai/smallpond[smallpond], a distributed DuckDB implementation that uses https://github.com/deepseek-ai/3FS[3FS] (also from Deepseek) and https://www.ray.io/[Ray]. https://www.definite.app/blog/smallpond[This blog post] gives a nice overview and assessment of it—including the summary "_Is smallpond for me? tl;dr: probably not_" :) Daniel Beach also https://dataengineeringcentral.substack.com/p/smallpond-distributed-duckdb[takes a look at it] with some code examples.
* Robin Linacre writes about https://www.robinlinacre.com/recommend_duckdb/[why DuckDB is his first choice for data processing].

== Kafka (and other Event Streaming technologies)

* Apache Kafka 4.0 has been released. See https://dlcdn.apache.org/kafka/4.0.0/RELEASE_NOTES.html[release notes], https://kafka.apache.org/blog#apache_kafka_400_release_announcement[blog post], and https://kafka.apache.org/downloads[download].
* https://blog.iggy.rs/posts/apache-incubator/[Iggy has joined the Apache Incubator]. They also published an https://blog.iggy.rs/posts/transparent-benchmarks/[interesting post] about benchmarking.
* Speaking of benchmarking, Redpanda and StreamNative had a https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/few-thoughts-streamnative-benchmark-matthew-schumpert-h8qbf/[dust up] over a https://streamnative.io/blog/how-we-run-a-5-gb-s-kafka-workload-for-just-50-per-hour[benchmark].
* https://wangjunfei.com/2025/02/10/Announcing-Stonemq-A-high-performance-and-efficient-message-queue-developed-in-Rust/[Stonemq] is a "A high-performance and efficient message queue developed in Rust" that "aims to outperform Kafka in scenarios with massive-scale queue clusters".
* A post about the https://broot.ca/kafka-at-the-low-end.html[challenges of using Kafka as a queue]—which as the author notes starts to become moot once KIP-932 is released, which it is now with https://dlcdn.apache.org/kafka/4.0.0/RELEASE_NOTES.html[Apache Kafka 4.0]. Gunnar Morling takes a look at the new functionality https://www.morling.dev/blog/kip-932-queues-for-kafka/[here].
* An example of https://callistaenterprise.se/blogg/teknik/2025/01/03/kroxylicious-kafka-encryption/[Kafka Record Encryption] using https://kroxylicious.io/[Kroxylicious].
* A bit of housekeeping from Trendyol in this blog post about https://medium.com/trendyol-tech/detecting-and-managing-unused-topics-in-kafka-clusters-a-scalability-and-resource-optimization-2bae8a4bafea[Detecting and Managing Unused Topics in Kafka Clusters].
* A very nice tool from Renato Mefi that https://evoura.com/kafka-traffic-visualizer/[visually simulates Kafka traffic]. Similar to the one from SoftwareMill https://softwaremill.com/kafka-visualisation/[a few years ago].

* Lalamove's talk from Flink Forward Asia last year about how their Flink architecture has been written up as a https://www.alibabacloud.com/blog/how-we-build-a-scalable-cost-effective-cloud-native-streaming-platform-in-lalamove_601999[blog post].

** link:/2025/03/10/data-wrangling-with-flink-sql/[Data Wrangling with Flink SQL]
** link:/2025/03/06/joining-two-streams-of-data-with-flink-sql/[Joining Two Streams of Data with Flink SQL]

* A punchy article from Ian Miell about https://blog.container-solutions.com/why-im-no-longer-talking-to-architects-about-microservices[why he is no longer talking to architects about microservices].

== Other stuff

* The trend for "landscape" posts/infographics in recent years can sometimes seem like an exercise in trying to shape reality to suit the world-view of a vendor—not to mention overwhelming the reader with the number of projects and technologies to try and comprehend. However, the https://substack.com/home/post/p-156586181[Open Source Data Engineering Landscape] that Alireza Sadeghi has put together is pretty decent and comprehensive list, with a solid set of analysis of each category.
* Gunnar Morling is a good friend of mine—and an excellent blogger. He was recently interviewed about technical blogging and https://writethatblog.substack.com/p/gunnar-morling-on-technical-blogging[shares some useful tips].
* https://www.autodidacts.io/troubleshooting/[Troubleshooting is a core skill]. Learning how to do it properly, in a considered and logical manner, will benefit you.
* Joe Reis recently opened a Discord server **Practical Data** that's a friendly and lively place to chat about data stuff. https://discord.gg/HhSZVvWDBb[Join here].
* If you have a Garmin device you'll find https://github.com/tcgoetz/GarminDB[this] fun. It lets you download all your data and analyse it yourself. It's based on Sqlite—I'm keen to see if I can use it with DuckDB :)

== And finally…

* If you've never seen the https://silent.org.pl/home/2022/06/13/the-floppotron-3-0/[Floppotron], it's a thing of wonder.
