> Implement WordCount

This is probably bread-and-butter for any seasoned programmer, but I enjoyed the simple process and satisfaction of breaking the problem down into steps to solve using what the tutorial had just covered. Sketching out the logic in pseudo-code first, I figured that I wanted to do this: 

<!--more-->


* For each word in the phrase: 
** Check if the word exists in the map already
*** Create it if it doesn't
** Add one to the map value

NOTE: link:/2020/06/25/learning-golang-some-rough-notes-s01e00/[Learning Go : Background]

Using `Printf` it was useful to check on how it was executing. 

{{< highlight go >}}
func WordCount(s string) map[string]int {
	w := make(map[string]int)

	for i, v := range strings.Fields(s) {
		fmt.Printf("Index: %d value %v\n",i, v)
		if _, o := w[v]; o == true {
			fmt.Printf("\tExisting map found for %v with value %d\n",v,w[v])
			w[v] = w[v] + 1
		} else {
			fmt.Printf("\tCreating new map for %v with value 1\n",v)
			w[v] = 1
		}
	}

	return w
}

I liked that the tutorial uses tests to check what you've done, and shows the expected output: 

{{< highlight go >}}
PASS
 f("I am learning Go!") = 
  map[string]int{"Go!":1, "I":1, "am":1, "learning":1}
PASS
 f("The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.") = 
  map[string]int{"The":1, "brown":1, "dog.":1, "fox":1, "jumped":1, "lazy":1, "over":1, "quick":1, "the":1}
PASS
 f("I ate a donut. Then I ate another donut.") = 
  map[string]int{"I":2, "Then":1, "a":1, "another":1, "ate":2, "donut.":2}
PASS
 f("A man a plan a canal panama.") = 
  map[string]int{"A":1, "a":2, "canal":1, "man":1, "panama.":1, "plan":1}
{{< /highlight >}}

Looking at the pseudo-code and what Golang will handle for you automagically it can be reduced to this: 

* For each word in the phrase:
** +++<del>+++Check if the word exists in the map already+++</del>+++ 
*** +++<del>+++Create it if it doesn't+++</del>+++ 
** Add one to the map value (implicitly create the map entry if it doesn't already exist)



{{< highlight go >}}
func WordCount(s string) map[string]int {
	w := make(map[string]int)

	for _, v := range strings.Fields(s) {
		w[v] = w[v] + 1
	}

	return w
}
{{< /highlight >}}

NOTE: the underscore character, representing a required variable that you're not going to use, is pretty useful.
