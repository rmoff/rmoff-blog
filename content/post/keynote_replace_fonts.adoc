Very short & sweet this post, but Google turned up nothing when I was stuck so hopefully I'll save someone else some head scratching by sharing this.

== The Problem

`Replace Fontsâ€¦` was greyed out in Keynote

Why's that a problem? Because I wanted to replace some fonts (duh) and there was no indication of why I couldn't

== The Solution

I had shared the presentation with a colleague

By unsharing it, the `Replace Fontsâ€¦` became accessible again ðŸ¤·
