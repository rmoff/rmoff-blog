In the link:/2020/07/02/learning-golang-some-rough-notes-s01e09-concurrency-channels-goroutines/[previous exercise] I felt my link:/2020/06/25/learning-golang-some-rough-notes-s01e00/[absence of a formal CompSci background] with the introduction of Binary Sorted Trees, and now I am concious of it again with learning about mutex. I'd _heard_ of them before, mostly when Oracle performance folk were talking about wait types - TIL it stands for `mutual exclusion`!

== Exercise: Web Crawler

👉 https://tour.golang.org/concurrency/10[A Tour of Go : Exercise: Web Crawler]

This was quite a fun one once I wrapped my head around it. It gave a health dose of copy & paste advice in the form of the https://tour.golang.org/concurrency/9[previous example] which I used to implement the first requirement.

=== Don't fetch the same URL twice

I created a `URLs` struct to hold a map of URLs and a boolean of whether they have been crawled or not, and included a mutex so that it can be read and updated safely in concurrent execution

{{< highlight go >}}
type URLs struct {
	c   map[string]bool
	mux sync.Mutex
}

var u URLs = URLs{c: make(map[string]bool)}
{{< /highlight >}}

The `URLs` type implements two functions - one to check if a given URL has been crawled, and the other to mark it as such

{{< highlight go >}}

func (u URLs) IsCrawled(url string) bool {
	fmt.Printf("\n👀 Checking if %v has been crawled…", url)
	u.mux.Lock()
	defer u.mux.Unlock()
	if _, ok := u.c[url]; ok == false {
		fmt.Printf("…it hasn't\t")
		return false
	}
	fmt.Printf("…it has\t")
	return true
}

func (u URLs) Crawled(url string) {
	u.mux.Lock()
	u.c[url] = true
	u.mux.Unlock()
}
{{< /highlight >}}

To the main `Crawl` function I then added calls to these functions and a conditional return: 

{{< highlight go >}}
// Check if the URL has been crawled already
if u.IsCrawled(url) == true {
    return
}
fmt.Printf("\n➡️ Crawling %v", url)
body, urls, err := fetcher.Fetch(url)
// Mark the URL as crawled (assumes that if there's an error you don't want to retry it)
u.Crawled(url)
{{< /highlight >}}

As the comment notes, we assume that if a URL has been crawled, then we mark it as such, regardless of error status. If I was feeling adventurous I guess I could implement some kind of retry logic with incremental backoff…but I'm keeping it simple for now :) 

=== Fetch URLs in parallel

This one I assumed could be done by simply using a Go routine in calling the nested `Crawl` functions. What it actually did was just fetch the first URL and exit

Off to Google we went and found https://stackoverflow.com/a/12250366/350613[this answer on StackOverflow] which showed the use of https://golang.org/pkg/sync/#WaitGroup[WaitGroups] (nice https://gobyexample.com/waitgroups[example here]). I ripped this off shamelessly into my code and it _almost_ worked…

but then threw a panic

{{< highlight go >}}
panic: sync: negative WaitGroup counter

goroutine 1 [running]:
sync.(*WaitGroup).Add(0xc0000a4010, 0xffffffffffffffff)
	/usr/local/go/src/sync/waitgroup.go:74 +0x1ec
sync.(*WaitGroup).Done(0xc0000a4010)
	/usr/local/go/src/sync/waitgroup.go:99 +0x34

	/Users/rmoff/go/src/webcrawler/webcrawler.go:73 +0x98
{{< /highlight >}}

A bit of Googling showed that `panic: sync: negative WaitGroup counter` (as the error actually suggests) comes about because https://golang.org/pkg/sync/#WaitGroup.Done[Done] had been called to decrease the number of WaitGroups and taken them below zero. 

This happened because every execution of `Crawl` includes

{{< highlight go >}}
defer wg.Done()
{{< /highlight >}}

but the corresponding 

{{< highlight go >}}
wg.Add(1)
{{< /highlight >}}

was only added in the _nested_ call to `Crawl` and not the initial invocation from `main()`. Adding this into `main()` then made everything work just great.

{{< highlight go "hl_lines=1 2 23 25 31-34">}}
func Crawl(url string, depth int, fetcher Fetcher, wg *sync.WaitGroup) {
	defer wg.Done()

	if depth <= 0 {
		return
	}

	// Check if the URL has been crawled already
	if u.IsCrawled(url) == true {
		return
	}
	fmt.Printf("\n➡️ Crawling %v", url)
	body, urls, err := fetcher.Fetch(url)
	// Mark the URL as crawled (assumes that if there's an error you don't want to retry it)
	u.Crawled(url)

	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println(err)
		return
	}
	fmt.Printf("\n\t->✅ found: %s %q\n", url, body)
	for _, z := range urls {
		wg.Add(1)

		Crawl(z, depth-1, fetcher, wg)
	}

}

func main() {
	wg := &sync.WaitGroup{}
	wg.Add(1)
	Crawl("https://golang.org/", 4, fetcher, wg)
	wg.Wait()
}
