There was a https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64241285/kafka-topic-with-variable-nested-json-object-as-ksql-db-stream/64242383#64242383[good question on StackOverflow] recently in which someone was struggling to find the appropriate ksqlDB DDL to model a source topic in which there was a variable number of fields in a `STRUCT`.

<!--more-->

This was their example: 

[source,javascript]
----
{
  "device" : "REDACTED",
  "context" : {
    "2" : "25",
    "3" : "0",
    "4" : "60",
    "1" : "REDACTED"
  }
}
----

[source,javascript]
----
{
  "device" : "REDACTED",
  "context" : {
    "2" : "2020-10-07T07:02:48.0000000Z",
    "1" : "REDACTED"
  }
}
----

So `context` looks like a STRUCT - but when they tried that they found that ksqlDB wouldn't return the data unless all four fields were included in the payload, and since it was variable, this wouldn't work. 

== The Answer - `MAP`

You need to use a `MAP` rather than a `STRUCT`. 

Here's a working example using ksqlDB 0.12. 

* Load the sample data into a topic
+
[source,javascript]
----
kafkacat -b localhost:9092 -P -t events <<EOF
{ "device" : "REDACTED", "event" : "403151", "firstOccurrenceTime" : "2020-09-30T11:03:50.000Z", "lastOccurrenceTime" : "2020-09-30T11:03:50.000Z", "occurrenceCount" : 1, "receiveTime" : "2020-09-30T11:03:50.000Z", "persistTime" : "2020-09-30T14:32:59.580Z", "state" : "open", "context" : { "2" : "25", "3" : "0", "4" : "60", "1" : "REDACTED" } }
{ "device" : "REDACTED", "event" : "402004", "firstOccurrenceTime" : "2020-10-07T07:02:48Z", "lastOccurrenceTime" : "2020-10-07T07:02:48Z", "occurrenceCount" : 1, "receiveTime" : "2020-10-07T07:02:48Z", "persistTime" : "2020-10-07T07:15:28.533Z", "state" : "open", "context" : { "2" : "2020-10-07T07:02:48.0000000Z", "1" : "REDACTED" } }
EOF
----

* In ksqlDB, declare the stream: 
+
[source,sql]
----
CREATE STREAM "events" (
    "device" VARCHAR,
    "event" VARCHAR,
    "firstOccurenceTime" VARCHAR,
    "lastOccurenceTime" VARCHAR,
    "occurenceCount" INTEGER,
    "receiveTime" VARCHAR,
    "persistTime" VARCHAR,
    "state" VARCHAR,
    "context" MAP < VARCHAR, VARCHAR >
) WITH (KAFKA_TOPIC = 'events', VALUE_FORMAT = 'JSON');
----

* Query the stream to check things work:
+
[source,sql]
----
ksql> SET 'auto.offset.reset' = 'earliest';
Successfully changed local property 'auto.offset.reset' to 'earliest'. Use the UNSET command to revert your change.

ksql> SELECT "device", "event", "receiveTime", "state", "context" FROM "events" EMIT CHANGES;
+----------+--------+--------------------------+--------+------------------------------------+
|device    |event   |receiveTime               |state   |context                             |

|REDACTED  |402004  |2020-10-07T07:02:48Z      |open    |{1=REDACTED, 2=2020-10-07T07:02:48.0|
|          |        |                          |        |000000Z}                            |
----

* Use the `['']` syntax to access specific keys within the map: 
+
[source,sql]
----
ksql> SELECT "device", "event", "context", "context"['1'] AS CONTEXT_1, "context"['3'] AS CONTEXT_3 FROM "events" EMIT CHANGES;
+-----------+--------+------------------------------------+-----------+-----------+

+-----------+--------+------------------------------------+-----------+-----------+
|REDACTED   |403151  |{1=REDACTED, 2=25, 3=0, 4=60}       |REDACTED   |0          |
|REDACTED   |402004  |{1=REDACTED, 2=2020-10-07T07:02:48.0|REDACTED   |null       |
|           |        |000000Z}                            |           |           |
