Kafka Connect has as https://docs.confluent.io/current/connect/references/restapi.html[REST API] through which all config should be done, including removing connectors that have been created. Sometimes though, you might have reason to want to manually do thisâ€”and since Kafka Connect running in distributed mode uses Kafka as its persistent data store, you can achieve this by manually writing to the topic yourself. 

<!--more-->

1. Stop the Kafka Connect workers. Inspect the Kafka Connect config to determine the name of the `config` topic, e.g. 
+
{{< highlight shell >}}
config.storage.topic=connect-configs
{{< /highlight >}}

2. Look at the existing topic contents (I like to use `kafkacat` because of its rich functionality when you go beyond simple consumption/production of data): 
+
{{< highlight shell >}}
kafkacat -b localhost:9092 -t connect-configs -C -K#
{{< /highlight >}}
+
{{< highlight shell >}}
connector-replicator-source#{"properties":{"connector.class":"io.confluent.connect.replicator.ReplicatorSourceConnector","key.converter":"io.confluent.connect.replicator.util.ByteArrayConverter","value.converter":"io.confluent.connect.replicator.util.ByteArrayConverter","header.converter":"io.confluent.connect.replicator.util.ByteArrayConverter","src.kafka.bootstrap.servers":"kafka:29092","dest.kafka.bootstrap.servers":"172.27.230.24:9092","topic.whitelist":"test_topic","name":"replicator-source"}}
% Reached end of topic connect-configs [0] at offset 1
{{< /highlight >}}
+
Note here there is a single connector, named `connector-replicator-source`. The config topic is a compacted one, and the message key is the name of the connector. I'm using `-K#` to tell kafkacat to delimit the key and value with a `#` symbol. 

3. Emit a tombstone (null) message to the topic for the key of the connector which you want to remove. 
+
To do this with kafkacat you simply use the `-Z` operator ("_send empty messages as NULL messages_"), and pass an empty message after the key. As above I'm using `#` as my key/value delimiter (and specifying this with `-K#`). 
+
{{< highlight shell >}}
echo 'connector-replicator-source#' | \
  kafkacat -b localhost:9092 -t connect-configs -P -Z -K#
{{< /highlight >}}

4. Restart the connect worker.
