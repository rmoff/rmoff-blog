Lightning talks are generally 5-10 minutes. As the name implies - they are quick! 

A good lightning talk is not just your breakout talk condensed into a shorter time frame. You can't simply deliver the same material faster, or the same material at a higher level, or the same material with a few bits left out

'''

A good lightning talk has been specifically conceived of as a *lightning talk*. Let's say it's a ten minute talk. You get on stage, clear your throat, thank everyone for coming. You're a minute in. 

You probably set the scene, explain why you're there, make a lame joke about conference coffee. Two minutes in. Eight to go. 

You have time to make one or two *at most* salient points that you want the audience to walk away with at the end 

The whole tell people what you're going to tell them / tell it to them / tell them what you told them -- that's ok by me, it's tried and tested - and so let's give a minute for "what you'll tell them", and a couple of minutes for "what you told them" recap 

Now we're down to five minutes. FIVE MINUTES to actually tell the audience something useful. That's *plenty of time* if you've thought long and hard about what that useful nugget or two of info is. But it's not going to materialise out of a breakout session abstract. 

'''

Think of your "elevator pitch" about the thing you want to talk about, and then flesh it out _just a tad_. That's your lightning talk there. Don't start with a long talk and cut it down. Start with the interesting nub of an idea and build around it _just a little bit_. 

Now you need to write your abstract.

Your abstract should mirror your talk: snappy, interesting, to the point, and engaging.

If your abstract for a lighting talk takes longer to read and grok than the talk itself, you're maybe doing it wrong. Your abstract should set the scene, make it *crystal clear* what the one or two things that you're going to deliver in your talk are, and then wrap up. That's all. 
You need to be specific.

* "_I'm going to talk about our project_" is not specific.
* "_I'll explain why we opted to deploy Kafka Connect in distributed mode rather than standalone_" is specific. 

Your abstract is your pitch; your abstract is the way the program committee will judge if your talk is likely to be any good. If your abstract is vague, waffly, boring, turgid, etc - the program committee are likely to assume that your talk will be too

Lightning talks can be out of the context of a larger project. Taking the example above - deploying Kafka Connect distributed vs standalone. Whether you did or didn't in your project, a lightning talk is a great way to share a cool tidbit of information you've learnt. 

⚡️Found a cool way to run Kafka Connect in a Docker container that's not so well known? Good lightning talk idea.

⚡️Got a really cool code pattern for checking that messages are delivered? Good lightning talk idea. 

⚡️Come up with a good workflow for debugging a Kafka client request in-flight that'll be useful for others? Good lightning talk idea.

⚡️Written a neat open-source tool that'll make Kafka SREs' lives easier and want to show it off? Good lightning talk idea. 

_(Why open-source? Well, showing off a tool you've written that no-one outside your org can actually use is a bit like taking your cool toy to school and boasting about it and then saying " `ner ner ner you can't use it` 😝" to anyone who asks for a go)_

A good lightning talk is *harder* to do than a breakout session in some ways. You have to be more disciplined in your delivery, you don't have the luxury of time to settle into it - by the time you've done that it's time to wrap up. This means that the program committee will be looking for abstracts that suggest the speaker is capable of delivering a good lightning talk - not just a breakout session delivered at speed.

*What does a good lightning talk look like?* For me, the canonical example has to be this legendary one from https://twitter.com/garybernhardt[@garybernhardt] - https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat[WAT]
