* _Where_: Starting from the conference hotel (https://www.fairmont.com/austin/[Fairmont Austin])
* _When_: **Tuesday 4th October**. 

We'll **meet at 06:30** in the foyer of the https://www.fairmont.com/austin/[Fairmont Austin]. That'll give us time to congrgate and take some https://twitter.com/search?q=%23streamingselfie%20%23kafkasummit%20since%3A2022-04-20&src=typed_query&f=live[`#streamingselfie`]s if you want them, before setting off at 06:40 sharp to make our way around the https://www.strava.com/clubs/1077377/group_events/1243826[the 5k route]. 

Go at your own pace; this isn't a race. You can run, or walk. Or skip, if you prefer. You can https://www.strava.com/clubs/1077377/group_events/1243826[download the route] to follow at your leisure. In fact, it's a good idea to do so because this is not an organised event, so it's your responsibility not to get lost :-D

At 6min/km it'll take half an hour to get round the 5k route. That should give you plenty of time to then take some more https://twitter.com/search?q=%23streamingselfie%20%23kafkasummit%20since%3A2022-04-20&src=typed_query&f=live[`#streamingselfie`]s before heading back into the hotel for breakfast and ready for the **start of the conference at 08:00**.

== Cool, where do I register? 

Register at `/dev/null` ;-) 

This is an entirely unofficial, barely-organised, thing. Turn up and run, if you want. Don't, if you don't. Fully intend to but sleep in from the jetlag and miss it, that's completely fine üòÅ
