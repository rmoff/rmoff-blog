After a break from using AWS I had reason to reacquaint myself with it again today, and did so via the CLI. The https://aws.amazon.com/cli/[AWS CLI] is pretty intuitive and has a good helptext system, but one thing that kept frustrasting me was that after closing the help text, the screen clearedâ€”so I couldn't copy the syntax out to use in my command!

The same thing happened when I ran a command that returned output - the screen cleared.

Here's how to fix either, or both, of these

== AWS CLI help text disappears when closed

The fix: set `MANPAGER` (https://ashley.raiteri.net/stop-aws-cli-help-command-from-clearing-screen/[h/t])

[source,bash]
----
export MANPAGER='less -isXF'

== AWS CLI command output disappears when closed

Similar to the above, but a different solution, which confuses the issue when Googling :)

You run a command, you want to refer to the output, but as soon as you return to the command prompt it's gone ðŸ¤¨

The fix: make sure that `AWS_PAGER` is set to the correct invocation of `less`. Or other options, including setting `--no-cli-pager` argument. This https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-usage-pagination.html#cli-usage-pagination-clientside[is documented] if you want to read more.

[source,bash]
----
export AWS_PAGER='less -isXF'

or simply

[source,bash]
----
unset AWS_PAGER
