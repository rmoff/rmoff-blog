I'm quite a fan of Sonos audio equipment but recently had some trouble with some of the devices glitching and even cutting out whilst playing. Under the covers Sonos stuff is running Linux (of course) and exposes some diagnostics through a rudimentary frontend that you can access at `\http://<sonos player IP>:1400/support/review`:

Whilst this gives you the current state, you can't get historical data on it. It _felt_ like the problems were happening "all the time", but *were they actually*? For that, we need some cold, hard, data! Something like this, in fact: 

{{< highlight sql >}}
+---------------------+---------+----------+---------------+
|WINDOW_START_TS      |DEVICE   |STATUS    |STATUS_COUNT   |
+---------------------+---------+----------+---------------+
|2020-01-21 00:00:00  |Kitchen  |YELLOW    |183            |
|2020-01-21 00:00:00  |Kitchen  |RED       |162            |

|2020-01-21 00:00:00  |Kitchen  |GREEN     |5              |

Summaries are nice, but so's a plot of the data over time: 

image::/images/2020/01/sonos01.png[Sonos connectivity data over time]

In this article I'll walk through how to collect this data and process it using some of my favourite tools including ksqlDB, InfluxDB, and Grafana. 

Which data are we going to collect? For now it's based on two metrics of interest here - `Noise Floor` and `OFDM ANI level`. Why these two? Well, if we open up the code behind the Network Matrix shown above, we can see the Javascript that defines the colour of the cells evaluates these two: 

{{< highlight javascript >}}
[…]
if( nf > 94 && ofdm > 4 )
    td.style.background = "rgb(32,190,32)"; // GREEN
else if( nf > 89 && ofdm > 3 )
    td.style.background = "rgb(255,255,32)"; // YELLOW
else if( nf > 84 && ofdm > 2 )
    td.style.background = "rgb(255,159,32)"; // ORANGE
else
    td.style.background = "rgb(255,32,32)"; // RED
[…]

== The stack

* `curl` to poll the API for diagnostics, and parse it with https://github.com/kislyuk/yq[`xq`]
* https://github.com/edenhill/kafkacat[kafkacat] to stream the data into Kafka
* https://kafka.apache.org[Apache Kafka] to stream and store the data
* https://ksqldb.io[ksqlDB] to process, wrangle, and query the data
* https://kafka.apache.org[Kafka Connect] to load the data into https://www.influxdata.com/[InfluxDB]
* https://grafana.com/[Grafana] to visualise it all

Why Kafka? Because we're doing all of this with streams of events. We want to have a low-latency pipeline from event to dashboard, and we also want to be able to replay and re-use the data. 

== Ingest diagnostics data from Sonos into Kafka

We're going to go full-MacGyver for part of this, since Sonos does not offer a nice API. The diagnostics that Sonos devices serve up on the `\http://<sonos player IP>:1400/support/review` interface (I'll not actually call it an API, since it isn't really) are XML-wrapped plaintext. So whilst XML may actually be nicer than YAML to work with (who knew), plain text is not so nice to work with. Fancy parsing this for key/value pairs? It's going to be all hand-crafted code needed: 

[source,bash]
----
Mode: INFRA (sonosnet)
Operating on channel 2437
Home channel is 2437
HT Channel is 0
RF Chains: RX:4 TX:4
RF Chainmask: RX:0x0F TX:0x0F
Max Spatial Streams: RX:4 TX:4
Noise Floor:    0 dBm (chain 0 ctl)
Noise Floor:    0 dBm (chain 1 ctl)
Noise Floor:    0 dBm (chain 2 ctl)
Noise Floor:    0 dBm (chain 3 ctl)
PHY errors since last reading/reset: 3882
----

To pull the data from Sonos you just need to hit one of the devices, since it serves up the stats for all the others too. I'm using https://github.com/kislyuk/yq[`xq`] here which is an XML version of the superb https://stedolan.github.io/jq/[`jq`] tool (which is for JSON). It means that I can stream data from `curl` into `xq` and parse the document structure for fields and values that I want, as well as starting to manipulate the data into more of a structure for processing (such as splitting the `status` data shown above into an array). 

Once it's parsed the data it pipes it into `kafkacat` which writes it to a Kafka topic, as well as echo'ing it to the terminal. 

[source,bash]
----
while [ 1 -eq 1 ];do 
    curl -s 'http://192.168.10.98:1400/support/review' | \
        xq -c '.ZPNetworkInfo.ZPSupportInfo[] |

                    select((. | contains("OFDM")) or (.|contains("Noise")) or (.|contains("PHY"))))]
                }' | \
            docker exec -i kafkacat kafkacat \
                -b kafka-1:39092,kafka-2:49092,kafka-3:59092 \
                -t sonos-metrics -P -T | jq '.'
    sleep 20

== Query the streams of data in ksqlDB

Now the data's in Kafka we can examine and process it with ksqlDB. First up we need to create a stream on top of the topic—which is just declaring the schema for the data: 

{{< highlight sql >}}
CREATE STREAM SONOS_RAW (ZPINFO STRING, DATA ARRAY<VARCHAR>,RAWDATA STRING) 
    WITH (KAFKA_TOPIC='sonos-metrics', VALUE_FORMAT='JSON');
{{< /highlight >}}


We can query this data: 

{{< highlight sql >}}
ksql> SET 'auto.offset.reset' = 'earliest';

ksql> SELECT TIMESTAMPTOSTRING(ROWTIME,'yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss','Europe/London') AS TS, 
             ZPINFO, 
             DATA 
        FROM SONOS_RAW 
        EMIT CHANGES 
        LIMIT 1;
+---------------------+-------------+-----------------------------------------------------------+
|TS                   |ZPINFO       |DATA                                                       |

|                     |             | (chain 1 ctl), Noise Floor:    0 dBm (chain 2 ctl), Noise |
|                     |             |Floor:    0 dBm (chain 3 ctl), PHY errors since last readin|
|                     |             |g/reset: 6803        ]                                     |
Limit Reached
Query terminated
ksql>
{{< /highlight >}}

and we can manipulate the data using standard SQL capabilities - for example to take a substring of a value and cast it to a new type: 

{{< highlight sql >}}
ksql> SELECT ZPINFO, 
             DATA[1],
             CAST(SUBSTRING(DATA[1],14,4) AS DOUBLE) AS NOISE_FLOOR_DBM0
     FROM   SONOS_RAW
     EMIT CHANGES;
+----------------+---------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------+
|ZPINFO          |KSQL_COL_1                                   |NOISE_FLOOR_DBM0                             |
+----------------+---------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------+
|Bedroom         |Noise Floor: -104 dBm (chain 0 ctl)          |-104.0                                       |
|Study (L)       |Noise Floor:    0 dBm (chain 0 ctl)          |0.0                                          |

== Transform the data in ksqlDB

The actual data that we want to pull out for now is just the device name (`ZPINFO`), `Noise Floor`, and `OFDM ANI level`. We'll do this with some data wrangling along the same lines as shown above. 

A key thing to note is that the `CREATE STREAM` here is now writing the results of this query to a new stream, underpinned by a new Kafka topic: 

{{< highlight sql >}}
CREATE STREAM SONOS_HEALTH_METRICS WITH (KAFKA_TOPIC='sonos_metrics_01') AS 
    SELECT MAP('DEVICE':=ZPINFO) AS TAGS,
            (( (CAST(SUBSTRING(DATA[1],14,4) AS DOUBLE) + CAST(SUBSTRING(DATA[2],14,4) AS DOUBLE) +  CAST(SUBSTRING(DATA[3],14,4) AS DOUBLE)) /3 )) AS AVG_NOISE_FLOOR_DBM,
            CAST(SUBSTRING(DATA[1],14,4) AS DOUBLE) AS NOISE_FLOOR_DBM0,
            CAST(SUBSTRING(DATA[2],14,4) AS DOUBLE) AS NOISE_FLOOR_DBM1,
            CAST(SUBSTRING(DATA[3],14,4) AS DOUBLE) AS NOISE_FLOOR_DBM2,
            CAST(SUBSTRING(DATA[5],17,2) AS INT) AS OFDM_ANI_LEVEL,
            (12-CAST(SUBSTRING(DATA[5],17,2) AS INT))/2 OFDM_ANI_LEVEL_ADJUSTED
    FROM   SONOS_RAW
    EMIT CHANGES ;
{{< /highlight >}}

Note the schemas includes a `MAP` for the tags, which we'll use to load into InfluxDB shortly. 

{{< highlight sql >}}

ksql> DESCRIBE SONOS_HEALTH_METRICS;

Name                 : SONOS_HEALTH_METRICS
 Field                   | Type
--------------------------------------------------------
 ROWTIME                 | BIGINT           (system)
 ROWKEY                  | VARCHAR(STRING)  (system)
 TAGS                    | MAP<STRING, VARCHAR(STRING)>
 AVG_NOISE_FLOOR_DBM     | DOUBLE
 NOISE_FLOOR_DBM0        | DOUBLE
 NOISE_FLOOR_DBM1        | DOUBLE
 NOISE_FLOOR_DBM2        | DOUBLE
 OFDM_ANI_LEVEL          | INTEGER
 OFDM_ANI_LEVEL_ADJUSTED | INTEGER
--------------------------------------------------------
For runtime statistics and query details run: DESCRIBE EXTENDED <Stream,Table>;
{{< /highlight >}}

From this fairly simple transformation we now have a set of metrics which we can query from the stream: 


{{< highlight sql >}}

ksql> SELECT TIMESTAMPTOSTRING(ROWTIME,'yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss','Europe/London') AS TS, 
             TAGS['DEVICE'] AS DEVICE, 
             AVG_NOISE_FLOOR_DBM, 
             OFDM_ANI_LEVEL_ADJUSTED 
        FROM SONOS_HEALTH_METRICS 
        EMIT CHANGES 
        LIMIT 5;
+---------------------+-------------+----------------------+-------------------------+

We can also query it from the underlying Kafka topic: 

{{< highlight sql >}}

== Transform the message structure to load into InfluxDB

In a moment we're going to stream all this data into InfluxDB, but first we need to do a little https://libquotes.com/linus-torvalds/quote/lbr1k4j[`random jiggling`] to get the data into an appropriate format. 

WARNING: This is not part of a normal ksqlDB pipeline! It's just a hacky workaround to deal with some slightly misaligned interfaces. 

In a nutshell, the InfluxDB connector needs the data to either have a schema embedded in the JSON, or the Avro schema to be constructed a certain way (`map` not `array`). Here we'll interpolate the JSON-with-schema shell with the payload value, using kafkacat: 

`kafkacat` reads from the topic, pipes it into `jq` which adds the schema definition, and then pipes it to another instance of `kafkacat` which writes it to a new topic. 

[source,bash]
----
docker exec -it kafkacat /bin/sh -c 'kafkacat -b kafka-1:39092,kafka-2:49092,kafka-3:59092 -q -u -X auto.offset.reset=latest -G sonos_rmoff_cg_01 sonos_metrics_01 |jq -c '"'"'. |
{   schema: { type: "struct", optional: false, version: 1, fields: [
            { field: "tags", type: "map", keys: {type: "string", optional: false}, values: {type: "string", optional: false}, optional: false },
            { field: "AVG_NOISE_FLOOR_DBM", type: "double", optional: true},
            { field: "NOISE_FLOOR_DBM0", type: "double", optional: true},
            { field: "NOISE_FLOOR_DBM1", type: "double", optional: true},
            { field: "NOISE_FLOOR_DBM2", type: "double", optional: true},
            { field: "OFDM_ANI_LEVEL", type: "double", optional: true},
            { field: "OFDM_ANI_LEVEL_ADJUSTED", type: "double", optional: true}]},
    payload: {
        tags:  .TAGS ,
        AVG_NOISE_FLOOR_DBM: .AVG_NOISE_FLOOR_DBM,
        NOISE_FLOOR_DBM0: .NOISE_FLOOR_DBM0,
        NOISE_FLOOR_DBM1: .NOISE_FLOOR_DBM1,
        NOISE_FLOOR_DBM2: .NOISE_FLOOR_DBM2,
        OFDM_ANI_LEVEL: .OFDM_ANI_LEVEL,
        OFDM_ANI_LEVEL_ADJUSTED: .OFDM_ANI_LEVEL_ADJUSTED
        }
}'"'"' | \
kafkacat -b kafka-1:39092,kafka-2:49092,kafka-3:59092 -t sonos_metrics_01_json_with_schema -P -T'
----

So this: 

[source,javascript]
----
{
  "TAGS": {
    "DEVICE": "Kitchen"
  },
  "AVG_NOISE_FLOOR_DBM": 104.33333333333333,
  "NOISE_FLOOR_DBM0": -104,
  "NOISE_FLOOR_DBM1": -109,
  "NOISE_FLOOR_DBM2": -100,
  "OFDM_ANI_LEVEL": 5,
  "OFDM_ANI_LEVEL_ADJUSTED": 3
}
----

Becomes this: 

[source,javascript]
----
{
    "schema": { "type": "struct", "optional": false, "version": 1, "fields": [ 
        {"field": "tags", "type": "map", "keys": { "type": "string", "optional": false }, "values": { "type": "string", "optional": false }, "optional": false }, 
        {"field": "AVG_NOISE_FLOOR_DBM", "type": "double", "optional": true },
        { "field": "NOISE_FLOOR_DBM0", "type": "double", "optional": true },
        { "field": "NOISE_FLOOR_DBM1", "type": "double", "optional": true },
        { "field": "NOISE_FLOOR_DBM2", "type": "double", "optional": true },
        { "field": "OFDM_ANI_LEVEL", "type": "double", "optional": true },
        { "field": "OFDM_ANI_LEVEL_ADJUSTED", "type": "double", "optional": true }
        ]
    },
    "payload": {
        "tags": { "device": "Dining Room" },
        "AVG_NOISE_FLOOR_DBM": -0,
        "NOISE_FLOOR_DBM0": 0,
        "NOISE_FLOOR_DBM1": 0,
        "NOISE_FLOOR_DBM2": 0,
        "OFDM_ANI_LEVEL": null,
        "OFDM_ANI_LEVEL_ADJUSTED": null
    }
}
----

Whilst kafkacat is pretty neat for this kind of message manipulation, note that it will not preserve the partition, timestamp, or header of the source message. 

== Stream data from Kafka into InfluxDB

Back in ksqlDB we can now create a connector: 

[source,sql]
----
CREATE SINK CONNECTOR SINK_INFLUX_01 WITH (
        'connector.class'               = 'io.confluent.influxdb.InfluxDBSinkConnector',
        'value.converter'               = 'org.apache.kafka.connect.json.JsonConverter',
        'value.converter.schemas.enable'= 'true',
        'topics'                        = 'sonos_metrics_01_json_with_schema',
        'influxdb.url'                  = 'http://influxdb:8086',
        'influxdb.db'                   = 'sonos',
        'measurement.name.format'       = 'metrics'
  );         
----

Check the connector status: 

[source,sql]
----
ksql> SHOW CONNECTORS;

 Connector Name | Type | Class                                       | Status
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 SINK_INFLUX_01 | SINK | io.confluent.influxdb.InfluxDBSinkConnector | RUNNING (1/1 tasks RUNNING)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
----

And in InfluxDB itself we can see data: 

{{< highlight shell >}}
docker exec -it influxdb influx -execute 'SHOW MEASUREMENTS' -database 'sonos'
name: measurements
name
----
metrics
----

docker exec -it influxdb influx -database 'sonos' -execute 'SELECT LAST("AVG_NOISE_FLOOR_DBM") FROM "metrics" GROUP BY "device" LIMIT 3;'
name: metrics
tags: device=Bedroom
time                last

== Visualisation

Grafana is the tool I'm more familiar with, and plays nicely with InfluxDB. 

image::/images/2020/01/sonos01.png[Sonos data plotted in Grafana]

I've taken the thresholds that the Sonos network matrix javascript code (quoted above) uses to determine good/warning/bad and overlaid these on the charts and used them to background colour the current values.

You can try the Grafana dashboard https://snapshot.raintank.io/dashboard/snapshot/qBALXdQGwjU37KTO8Q1zAZ7o8IjaGisB[here].

It's worth noting that in recent years Influx have developed their own visualisation tool, Chronograf, which is pretty nice too

== Aggregation in ksqlDB

Because ksqlDB gives you a SQL interface to the data in Apache Kafka you can do things like: 

* Apply threshold calculations to the data as it passes through: 
+
{{< highlight sql >}}
CREATE STREAM DEVICE_STATUS AS 
    SELECT TIMESTAMPTOSTRING(ROWTIME,'yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss','Europe/London') AS TS, 
            TAGS['DEVICE'] AS DEVICE, 
            AVG_NOISE_FLOOR_DBM,
            OFDM_ANI_LEVEL_ADJUSTED,

== Try it out!

Grab the https://github.com/confluentinc/demo-scene/blob/master/sonos[Docker Compose from here], and give it a whirl. 

1. You need to find the IP of your Sonos device (e.g. from the Sonos mobile app `About My System`), and put this in the `log-sonos-to-kafka.sh` file and then execute it: 
+
{{< highlight shell >}}
./log-sonos-to-kafka.sh
{{< /highlight >}}

2. Launch ksqlDB CLI: 
+
{{< highlight shell >}}
docker exec -it ksqldb-cli bash -c 'echo -e "\n\n⏳ Waiting for ksqlDB to be available before launching CLI\n"; while : ; do curl_status=$(curl -s -o /dev/null -w %{http_code} http://ksqldb-server:8088/info) ; echo -e $(date) " ksqlDB server listener HTTP state: " $curl_status " (waiting for 200)" ; if [ $curl_status -eq 200 ] ; then  break ; fi ; sleep 5 ; done ; ksql http://ksqldb-server:8088'
{{< /highlight >}}

Then run through the article as shown, and enjoy! 

You'll find Grafana at http://localhost:3000 (login `admin`/`admin`) and Chronograf at http://localhost:8888/.

== Appendix : TODO

* The data at `\http://<sonos player IP>:1400/support/review` also includes other things that would be interesting to extract and plot: 
** the signal strength between each device
** the `ifconfig` stats for each device (packets received/dropped/errors etc)

== Appendix : Other interesting Sonos web endpoints

* `/status/zp`
* `/status/proc/ath_rincon/status`
* `/status/ifconfig`
* `/status/showstp`
* `/tools.htm`

== So…did you fix your Sonos problems?

So I started this article with a teaser about a problem with my Sonos equipment, and how I wanted to try and troubleshoot it. What did I learn (other than plain-text is a crappy way to share metrics and is a PITA to parse)?

Well, whilst doing all this data stuff, I also moved all but one of my Sonos devices to "SonosNet", and away from wired connections. I'm using Powerline connectors in my house for hard wiring, and it's not always great. Turns out the Sonos devices on their own wifi network work much better. So now I have a single Sonos device that's wired into my router, and the rest just use a wifi link between themselves (separate from my home wifi network). This seems to have fixed the problem that I had with "burbling" and cutouts. 

== Footnote

Turns out the timing of this blog https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/30/21042871/sonos-recycle-mode-trade-up-program-controversy[wasn't so great]:
