Let's not bury the lede: it was DNS. However, unlike the meme (_"It's not DNS, it's never DNS. It was DNS"_), I didn't even have an inkling that DNS might be the problem.

I'm writing a new blog about streaming Apache Kafka data to Apache Iceberg and wanted to provision a local Kafka cluster to pull data from remotely. I got this working nicely just last year using link:/2023/11/01/using-apache-kafka-with-ngrok/[ngrok to expose the broker to the interwebz], so figured I'd use this again. Simple, right?

Nope.

Spinning up https://rmoff.net/code/docker-compose-ngrok-kafka.yml[this Docker Compose] should have worked just fine (it did last year!). But for some reason my Kafka broker couldn't be reached (`Connection refused`).

## The Basic Setup

After a lot of poking and prodding and changing stuff and still no luck with Kafka, I decided to strip it back. No Docker Compose, just Kafka. Just netcat listening on a port:

[source,bash]
----
nc -lk 4242
----

From another terminal window I can test connectivity to the host/port:

[source,bash]
----
‚ùØ nc -z localhost 4242
Connection to localhost port 4242 [tcp/*] succeeded!
----

Now let us layer in ngrok, and add a route for the local netcat listener:

[source,bash]
----
‚ùØ ngrok tcp 4242

----

With this, we should be able to connect with netcat on the tcp host/port given:

[source,bash]
----
‚ùØ nc -vz 0.tcp.eu.ngrok.io 13810
nc: connectx to 0.tcp.eu.ngrok.io port 13810 (tcp) failed: Connection refused
----

## Let's dig into the problem

One thing that I did think of early on was that I run https://nextdns.io/[nextDNS] (similar to https://pi-hole.net/[Pi-Hole], if you're familiar with that) which can occassionally have unintended sideeffects when it comes to networking and resolving names. So I disabled it, and tried again:

[source,bash]
----
‚ùØ nc -vz 0.tcp.eu.ngrok.io 13810
nc: connectx to 0.tcp.eu.ngrok.io port 13810 (tcp) failed: Connection refused
----

Dusting off my troubleshooting command line toolbox, I tried a `mtr` (like `traceroute` but fancier):

What caught my eye here was the final hop‚Äî`lang-sspiprxy.network.virginmedia.net`. My ISP is Virgin Media, but the only entry I'd expected to see relating to it was my own IP.

Why is traffic for `0.tcp.eu.ngrok.io` going to `81.99.162.48` (`lang-sspiprxy.network.virginmedia.net`)?

The DNS server is my local router (`192.168.10.1`) which in turn is defaulting to the ISP's DNS servers. What about if we use a https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/what-is-1.1.1.1/[trusted public DNS like Cloudflare]'s?

Huh. `18.197.239.5` is different from `81.99.162.48`, definitely. Now that we're in the realms of DNS, let's switch NextDNS back on and see what happens:

[source,bash]

Well, just look at that:

**`..Blocked by NextDNS`** 

Now the penny is starting to drop. If you're particularly observant you'll notice the error that I showed at the very top of this blog says `Connect to ipv4#0.0.0.0:16689 failed` ‚Äîand `0.0.0.0` is what the `dig` above shows NextDNS resolves the ngrok hostname to.

In the logs that NextDNS provides I can see: 

image::/images/2024/05/nextdns01.webp[NextDNS screenshot showing DNS resolution for ngrok blocked by Threat Intelligence Feeds blocklist]

As well as blocking crap like ads and tracking domains, NextDNS also blocks DNS resolutions for sites that are deemed nefarious. It looks like ngrok ended up on one of https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/glossary/threat-intelligence-feed/[these lists] - probably because ngrok is sometimes abused to https://cyble.com/blog/ngrok-platform-abused-by-hackers-to-deliver-a-new-wave-of-phishing-attacks/[serve phishing websites] etc. After adding `*.ngrok.io` to my NextDNS Allowlist I got this:

[source,bash]
----
‚ùØ nc -vz 0.tcp.eu.ngrok.io 13810
Connection to 0.tcp.eu.ngrok.io port 13810 [tcp/*] succeeded!
----

Success!

image::/images/2024/05/yay.webp[Yay]

So NextDNS was, in a sense, a problem of my own making. But my ISP blocking this traffic is not something I'd expected. It turns out that Virgin Media offer "Web Safe" which includes "Virus Safe" which is enabled by default. After opting out of it, the ngrok address resolved correctly for me too:

[source,bash]

 0 topics:
----

With ngrok on the Allowlist for NextDNS, everything works great. I'll probably leave the "Virus Safe" at my ISP switched on unless it continues to cause these kind of problems. I'm also going to switch over my router's DNS to use Cloudflare (1.1.1.1) in the future.

== Footnote: A final puzzle - why does `+trace` on `dig` bypass the filtering?

This is the case on both NextDNS and Virgin Media. If I put the blocks back to how they were when I started looking at this and run `dig` normally, I get the blocked IP result as expected: 

[source,bash]
----
# NextDNS
‚ùØ dig +short 0.tcp.eu.ngrok.io
0.0.0.0

# Virgin Media
‚ùØ dig +short 0.tcp.eu.ngrok.io
81.99.162.48
----

But if I use `+trace` then in amongst the detailed trace info, I get the correct ngrok IP resolution:
