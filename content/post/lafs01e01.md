Like a fortunate child on Christmas Day, I've got a brand new toy! A brand new—to me—open-source technology to unwrap, learn, and perhaps even aspire to master elements of within. 

I [joined Decodable](/2023/09/21/an-itch-that-just-has-to-be-scratched-or-why-am-i-joining-decodable) two weeks ago, and since [Decodable](https://decodable.co/) is built on top of [Apache Flink](https://flink.apache.org) it seems like a great time to learn it. After six years learning Apache Kafka and hearing about this "Flink" thing but—for better or worse—never investigating it, I now have the perfect opportunity to do so.

Just like the aforementioned kid with a new toy, what else would I do except run around with wild excitement (figuratively), clicking on all the Apache Flink links and demos and tutorials and presentations and videos that I could find! And then I realised I should take somewhat of a more measured approach to my learning, and started to map out the different areas.

Breaking this out into sub-topics gives me nice little nuggets to start exploring (and blogging about, of course!). These include: 

* What _is_ Flink (high level)
	* Uses & Users
	* How do you run Flink
	* Who can use Flink?
		* Java nerds only, or ~~normal~~ non-Java folk too? 😜
	* Resources
* Flink Architecture, Concepts, and Components
* Learn some Flink!
* Where does Flink sit in relation to other software in this space? 
	* A mental map for me, not a holy war of streaming projects

Some of these are going to be fairly self-contained (what _is_ Flink) whilst others (learning Flink) are going to be a multi-year journey :)
