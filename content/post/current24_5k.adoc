At https://current.confluent.io/[Current 24] a few of us will be going for an early run (or walk) on Tuesday morning. Everyone is very welcome!

<!--more-->

Going out to stretch our legs before the conference starts has become a bit of a tradition now, starting back with https://twitter.com/rmoff/status/1179047181891883008[Kafka Summit SF 2019], skipping a few years for ü¶†, and resuming with https://twitter.com/rmoff/status/1518490053152026624[Kafka Summit London 2022], https://x.com/rmoff/status/1577271642119892994[Current 2022], and https://x.com/rmoff/status/1769996561440805312[Kafka Summit London 2024] earlier this year.

We're going to do the same thing again at Current 2024 in Austin!

* _Where_: Starting from the https://www.marriott.com/en-gb/hotels/travel/ausmd-austin-marriott-downtown[Austin Marriott Downtown]
* _When_: **Tuesday 17th September**.

We'll **meet at 06:30** in the foyer of the https://www.marriott.com/en-gb/hotels/travel/ausmd-austin-marriott-downtown[Austin Marriott Downtown] (just near the convention center). That'll give us time to congrgate and take some https://twitter.com/search?q=%23streamingselfie%20%23kafkasummit%20since%3A2022-04-20&src=typed_query&f=live[`#streamingselfie`]s if you want them, before setting off at *06:35 sharp* to make our way around the https://www.strava.com/routes/3265727282680501586[the 5k route].

Go at your own pace; this isn't a race. You can run, or walk. Or skip, if you prefer. You can https://www.strava.com/routes/3265727282680501586[download the route] to follow at your leisure. In fact, it's a good idea to do so because this is not an organised event, so it's your responsibility not to get lost :-D

At 6min/km it'll take half an hour to get round the 5k route. That should give you plenty of time to then take some more https://twitter.com/search?q=%23streamingselfie%20%23kafkasummit%20since%3A2022-04-20&src=typed_query&f=live[`#streamingselfie`]s before heading back into the hotel for breakfast and ready for the **start of the conference at 08:00** (https://events.bizzabo.com/599116/agenda/session/1336760[breakfast] at 0800, https://events.bizzabo.com/599116/agenda/session/1336742[keynote] at 0900).

=== How en-lightening! üî¶

You might consider bringing a head torch‚Äîa few bits of the route down by the river are unlit, and https://www.timeanddate.com/sun/usa/austin[sunrise isn't until 07:08].

== Did someone say swag? ‚ú®

Courtesy of https://decodable.co[Decodable], there'll be some exclusive, never-to-be-repeated (until next time) Current 5k run/walk stickers for anyone who takes part.

Swing by our booth in the expo hall to collect yours :)

== Cool, where do I register?

Register at `/dev/null` ;-) 

This is an entirely unofficial, barely-organised, thing. Turn up and run, if you want. Don't, if you don't. Fully intend to but sleep in from the jetlag and miss it, that's completely fine üòÅ
