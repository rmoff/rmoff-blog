Kibana's map functionality is a powerful way to visualise data that has a location element in it. I was recently working with data about ships at sea, and whilst the built in `Road map` is very good it doesn't show much maritime detail.

Kibana's map visualisation has the option to pull in additional visual information from other places (known as tile servers). I found https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tile_servers[a list of Tile servers], which had details of https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/OpenSeaMap[OpenSeaMap] which includes: 

> beacons, buoys and other seamarks, port information, repair shops, ship supplies and much more, but also shops, restaurants and places of interest

Adding the tile server details is relatively easy - the trick is getting the incantation of the URL exactly right (which is why I'm even writing this up in the first place, because it took me a bit of fiddling). 

1. Click on `Add layer`

2. Select `Tile Map Service`

3. Enter the details

* Url: `https://tiles.openseamap.org/seamark/{z}/{x}/{y}.png`
* Attribution text: `OpenSeaMap`
* Attrinbution link: `http://openseamap.org/`
+

4. Click the `Add layer` button at the bottom, and optionally give the layer a name on the next screen, and click `Save & close`

You now get visuals from OpenSeaMap overlaid, showing things like shipping lanes at a high level…

…down to much more detailed attributes:

Of course, Kibana is not just a map viewer - it's a data visualisation tool in which maps provide the canvas on which to illustrate the data, like this:
