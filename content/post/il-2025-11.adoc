_Not got time for all this? I've marked 🔥 for my top reads of the month_ :)

== Kafka and Event Streaming

* A trio of articles from Zeinab Dashti about exactly-once processing in Kafka, using the https://medium.com/threadsafe/exactly-once-processing-across-kafka-and-databases-using-kafka-transactions-idempotent-writes-09fe1f75bdab[Transactions], the https://medium.com/threadsafe/exactly-once-processing-across-kafka-and-databases-using-the-outbox-pattern-f08fd640f683[Outbox Pattern], and the https://medium.com/threadsafe/exactly-once-processing-across-kafka-and-databases-using-the-listen-to-yourself-pattern-0add785f988a[Listen-to-Yourself Pattern]
* Another nice post from Stefan Kecskes, this time exploring https://skey.uk/post/kraft-the-kafka-raft/[what KRaft is and what the migration process looks like].
* An interesting blog post from last year in which Andy Pearce gives https://www.andy-pearce.com/blog/posts/2024/Jun/blazingmq-introduction/[an introduction] to https://bloomberg.github.io/blazingmq/[BlazingMQ].
* Taking a break from his hOT TaKEs about the imminent demise of Kafka, Stanislav Kozlovski shared on Reddit a https://old.reddit.com/r/apachekafka/comments/1oyljxp/the_floor_price_of_kafka_in_the_cloud/[useful comparison of the floor price of Kafka on hosted services]. Predictably, there was plenty of disagreement in the ensuing thread about the criterion used in the comparison—and this discussion in itself was useful as food for thought when making these comparisons for yourself.
* 🔥 I love this series of posts from Geoff Williams in which he hooks up a home-built weather station to https://www.declarativesystems.com/2025/11/15/home-assistant-confluent-cloud.html[stream readings to Kafka via Home Assistant].
* Luthra Sahil writes about building https://medium.com/@luthra.sahil.txs/scaling-email-sync-to-thousands-of-inboxes-our-kafka-powered-architecture-11dffefcef8e[an email sync platform based around Kafka].
* A couple of interesting posts from Ian Duncan, covering https://www.iankduncan.com/engineering/2025-11-14-event-design-for-streaming-systems[Event Design for Streaming Systems] and details of https://www.iankduncan.com/engineering/2025-11-24-json-schema-demystified[JSON Schema].
(If you struggle reading the grey-on-black text, opening it in Safari and using the Reader view works well).
