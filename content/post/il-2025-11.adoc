_Not got time for all this? I've marked 🔥 for my top reads of the month_ :)

== Kafka and Event Streaming
* A trio of articles from Zeinab Dashti about exactly-once processing in Kafka, using the https://medium.com/threadsafe/exactly-once-processing-across-kafka-and-databases-using-kafka-transactions-idempotent-writes-09fe1f75bdab[Transactions], the https://medium.com/threadsafe/exactly-once-processing-across-kafka-and-databases-using-the-outbox-pattern-f08fd640f683[Outbox Pattern], and the https://medium.com/threadsafe/exactly-once-processing-across-kafka-and-databases-using-the-listen-to-yourself-pattern-0add785f988a[Listen-to-Yourself Pattern]
* Another nice post from Stefan Kecskes, this time exploring https://skey.uk/post/kraft-the-kafka-raft/[what KRaft is and what the migration process looks like].
* An interesting blog post from last year in which Andy Pearce gives https://www.andy-pearce.com/blog/posts/2024/Jun/blazingmq-introduction/[an introduction] to https://bloomberg.github.io/blazingmq/[BlazingMQ].
* Taking a break from his hOT TaKEs about the imminent demise of Kafka, Stanislav Kozlovski shared on Reddit a https://old.reddit.com/r/apachekafka/comments/1oyljxp/the_floor_price_of_kafka_in_the_cloud/[useful comparison of the floor price of Kafka on hosted services]. Predictably, there was plenty of disagreement in the ensuing thread about the criterion used in the comparison—and this discussion in itself was useful as food for thought when making these comparisons for yourself.
* 🔥 I love this series of posts from Geoff Williams in which he hooks up a home-built weather station to https://www.declarativesystems.com/2025/11/15/home-assistant-confluent-cloud.html[stream readings to Kafka via Home Assistant].
* Luthra Sahil writes about building https://medium.com/@luthra.sahil.txs/scaling-email-sync-to-thousands-of-inboxes-our-kafka-powered-architecture-11dffefcef8e[an email sync platform based around Kafka].
* A couple of interesting posts from Ian Duncan, covering https://www.iankduncan.com/engineering/2025-11-14-event-design-for-streaming-systems[Event Design for Streaming Systems] and details of https://www.iankduncan.com/engineering/2025-11-24-json-schema-demystified[JSON Schema].
(If you struggle reading the grey-on-black text, opening it in Safari and using the Reader view works well).

* Ananth Packkildurai has https://www.dataengineeringweekly.com/p/engineering-growth-the-data-layers[a good article] about the data systems needed to support modern "go to market" operations including marketing and sales and taking into account various privacy laws.

== Data Engineering, Pipelines, and CDC
* Is it too meta, in a list of interesting links, to link to a list of links?
I don't care, because https://blog.dataengineerthings.org/the-awesome-list-of-resources-for-analytics-engineering-6e5759eeaa39[this list] from Faruk Tufekci of resources for analytics engineers is really useful!
* Detailed articles from Jan Zedníček looking at how to use dbt to https://janzednicek.cz/en/fabric-dbt-slowly-changing-dimension-scd-2-snapshots-and-check-strategy-in-dbt/[handle] and https://janzednicek.cz/en/fabric-dbt-how-i-build-gold-layer-dimensional-tables-scd2-in-data-projects/[implement] SCD2.

* LinkedIn's Gaojie Liu and Jialin Liu explain how the https://www.linkedin.com/blog/engineering/infrastructure/evolution-of-the-venice-ingestion-pipeline[ingestion pipeline for Venice] works.
* Hans-Peter Grahsl has published a nice https://github.com/hpgrahsl/streaming-lakehouse-playground[Docker Compose] to spin up Flink, Fluss, and LanceDB.
The https://github.com/hpgrahsl/streaming-lakehouse-playground/blob/main/README.md[README] has a good overview of how and why you might want to experiment with the particular stack.
* The https://github.com/alrpal/TinyETL[TinyETL] project from Alex Nemeth looks interesting for simple full-load data movement between standard formats and RDBMS.
* 🔥 Excellent detailed post from Andrew Zhang and Sanketh Balakrishna at Datadog explaining https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/engineering/cdc-replication-search/[how they use Kafka Connect and Debezium] to replicate from Postgres to Elasticsearch and Iceberg, including handling schemas and more.
* 🔥 If the above article from Datadog whet your appetite for what you can build with Kafka Connect, you'll love https://skey.uk/post/kafka-connectors-more-than-just-configs/[this practical and clear introduction to Kafka Connect] and its components and concepts from Stefan Kecskes.

== Open Table Formats (OTF), Catalogs, Lakehouses etc.
_Lots of links in this category this month!_
_I've split out some of the technology-specific stuff into their own sections below._

* Alexandre Bergere has https://medium.com/datalex/from-lakehouse-to-lakebase-why-databricks-buying-neon-changes-everything-ba4c1bcfa148[analysis] of Databrick's acquisition of Neon and what it means for their platform.
* OTF bake-off blogs might be old-hat, but this one https://medium.com/@gabriel.io/f7b3a987bf54[comparing Iceberg/Delta/Hudi] from Gabriel Popa adds a new spin to it - data sovereignty requirements for Switzerland.
* https://lists.apache.org/thread/cy6y5xf5gg8fr12pg64f77gxdrtv52fn[Discussion in the Apache community] about optimisation proposals for Parquet and how to move them forward within the project structures.
* 🔥 Umesh Dangat and Toby Cole from Yelp with details of their https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/how-yelp-modernized-its-data-infrastructure-with-a-streaming-lakehouse-on-aws/[adoption of Apache Paimon for their "streamhouse"].

=== Apache Fluss

_It's not a table format…it's not a lakehouse…it's…Fluss_ `¯\\_(ツ)_/¯`
_(If you've got a better category or mental-model for me to bucket it into, let me know in the comments below!)_

* Giannis Polyzos and Jark Wu have details of the https://fluss.apache.org/blog/releases/0.8/[Fluss 0.8 release]
* A useful overview from Alibaba of https://www.alibabacloud.com/blog/apache-fluss-vs--apache-paimon-two-engines-for-the-real-time-lakehouse_602687[Fluss and Paimon]; what they do, where they overlap, how to decide if they fit your requirements.
* https://fluss.apache.org/blog/taobao-practice/[Real-world details of Fluss in action] in this blog from Xinyu Zhang and Lilei Wang at TaoBao, looking in detail at why they adopted it and how they use it.
* 🔥 The https://db.cs.cmu.edu/seminars/fall2025/[Future Data Systems Seminar Series] from Carnegie Mellon University Database Research Group is a very cool free resource with weekly deep-dives from experts in the industry.
https://db.cs.cmu.edu/events/future-data-apache-fluss-a-streaming-storage-for-real-time-lakehouse/[The lecture on 8th December] is from the original creator of Fluss, Jark Wu.
All the talks are recorded and available online afterwards.

=== Apache Iceberg

* Two years ago one would have thought hell were freezing (Iceberg! freezing! geddit?!) over with https://www.databricks.com/blog/advancing-lakehouse-apache-iceberg-v3-databricks[Databricks announcing full support for Iceberg v3], but following the acquisition of Tabular and the wide adoption of Iceberg in the industry, it seems a pretty sensible move.
* Two good Iceberg blogs from Jack Vanlightly this month.
The first covers the nitty-gritty of a very real "rubber meets the road" integration question; if you're writing from Kafka to Iceberg, https://jack-vanlightly.com/blog/2025/11/5/how-would-you-like-your-iceberg-sir-stream-or-batch-ordered[how do you square the circle of choosing what kind of access to optimise the data layout] for?
(Jark Wu has an https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jarkwu_new-blog-post-how-would-you-like-your-iceberg-activity-7392227653434519552-au-Q/[interesting reply to it here].)
In his second post he looks at the idea of https://jack-vanlightly.com/blog/2025/11/19/have-your-iceberg-cubed-not-sorted-meet-qbeast-the-otree-spatial-index[OTree Spatial Indexes for Iceberg].
* Cloudera's Ayush Saxena looks at how https://medium.com/@ayushtkn/basic-variant-datatype-support-in-apache-hive-with-apache-iceberg-93c8518fcea9[Apache Hive now supports Iceberg's implementation of the Varient data type].
* A good writeup from Manishankar Ravuri examining https://medium.com/@manishankarravuri/how-iceberg-and-delta-lake-handle-deletes-a-deep-dive-fb6fe81010fa[how deletions are handled] in different versions of the Iceberg spec, and in Delta Lake.
* The surest sign of solid adoption of a technology is when tools supporting its use spring up in parallel to the project itself.
Jack Leitch from Whoop has written about https://engineering.prod.whoop.com/glacierbase/[Glacierbase, which they have written to manage schemas across their PBs of Iceberg tables].
* Marc Selwan has written https://iceberg.rest[a cool front-end for the Iceberg Catalog, `iceberg.rest`].
* This is amazing from Snowflake (a company not originally renowned for open source work): they've open-sourced https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/pg_lake[pg_lake] which enables you to access Iceberg tables from within Postgres.
Open source and open standards FTW!

=== Apache Hudi

* https://hudi.apache.org/blog/2025/11/25/apache-hudi-release-1-1-announcement/[Apache Hudi 1.1] has been released, Shiyan Xu has the details.
* Interesting summary of a talk from ad-tech company FreeWheel about https://hudi.apache.org/blog/2025/11/07/how-freewheel-uses-apache-hudi-to-power-its-data-lakehouse/[their use of Hudi], including its replacement of a Spark/Presto/Clickhouse-based Lambda architecture.
* Onehouse are https://www.linkedin.com/posts/vinothchandar_apachehudi-xtable-opendata-share-7396231040702418944-_22f/[definitely not pivoting away from Hudi], as they launch their https://www.onehouse.ai/blog/announcing-spark-and-sql-on-the-onehouse-compute-runtime-with-quanton[faster-Spark runtime, Quanton] with claimed performance improvements for https://www.onehouse.ai/blog/apache-iceberg-on-quanton-3x-faster-apache-spark-workloads[Spark/Iceberg (wait, what?) workloads] too.
* A nice https://hudi.apache.org/blog/2025/10/29/deep-dive-into-hudis-indexing-subsystem-part-1-of-2/[two-part] https://hudi.apache.org/blog/2025/11/12/deep-dive-into-hudis-indexing-subsystem-part-2-of-2/[deep-dive] series about indexes in Hudi.

== RDBMS
* Vlad Bokov has a good hands-on explainer of https://medium.com/fresha-data-engineering/shrinking-me-softly-7836fdd1db76[how Fresha reduced their 4TB Postgres database on RDS by 75%].
* A handy reminder from Elizabeth Christensen about https://www.crunchydata.com/blog/postgres-internals-hiding-in-plain-sight[how to find your way around Postgres' catalog and system tables].
* Useful https://muratbuffalo.blogspot.com/2025/11/disaggregated-database-management.html[notes] from Murat Demirbas discussing https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.01269[a 2022 paper] on Disaggregated Database Management Systems.
Murat also presented on the topic at InfoQ, and Steef-Jan Wiggers has written up https://www.infoq.com/news/2025/11/disaggregated-systems-qcon/[a summary of the talk].
* 🔥 You do test your Postgres queries, right? Right?
https://boringsql.com/posts/regresql-testing-queries/[This article] from Radim Marek discusses his https://github.com/boringSQL/regresql[fork of RegreSQL] and how it can be used to test a bunch of stuff including performance and query plan regresssions.
* The SQL standard working group has formally accepted a change to the SQL standard to https://peter.eisentraut.org/blog/2025/11/11/waiting-for-sql-202y-group-by-all[add support for `GROUP BY ALL`].
* https://duckdb.org/2025/11/12/announcing-duckdb-142[DuckDB 1.4.2 LTS] adds https://duckdb.org/2025/11/12/announcing-duckdb-142#iceberg-improvements[support for insert, update, and delete] statements on Iceberg tables from DuckDB.
* 🔥 I loved https://www.p99conf.io/session/chatgpt-aint-got-on-me/[this talk from Andy Pavlo] at P99 Conf about practical research done into optimising query execution using techniques including—but not limited—to LLMs.
* In a similar vein, Alper Çiftçi from Trendyol writes about their experience https://medium.com/trendyol-tech/ai-powered-postgresql-query-optimization-a-comprehensive-approach-a646950eb5a3[[using AI to optimise Postgres queries].
* Sometimes it doesn't need an LLM to figure out how to optimise your queries; Nimisha Vernekar has a good primer on https://blog.dataengineerthings.org/sql-query-optimization-modern-techniques-and-best-practices-%EF%B8%8F-32db686d235d[basic query optimisation techniques] that it would behove anyone working with SQL to understand.
* Snowflake might have enabled access from Postgres to Iceberg with their open-source https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/pg_lake[pg_lake] (see above), but DuckDB now has https://github.com/duckdb/pg_duckdb[pg_duckdb], with which you can use DuckDB from within Postgres and thus access not only Iceberg but the multitude of other sources and types of data that DuckDB can read.
What a time to be alive in the data world 😁

== General Data Stuff
* 🔥 I've loved using notebooks like Zeppelin and Jupyter for years, and several times people have recommended I look at https://docs.marimo.io/[Marimo] - https://towardsdatascience.com/why-im-making-the-switch-to-marimo-notebooks/[this article] from Parul Pandey makes such a compelling case for it I _really_ do need to take a look. Maybe a project for the quiet holiday period :)
* https://rayforcedb.com/[RayforceDB] is a new https://github.com/singaraiona/rayforce[open-source] (MIT license) columnar database less than 1Mb in size, and written in C.
* Lots of people were impacted by the Cloudflare outage earlier this month; what I found interesting in the https://blog.cloudflare.com/18-november-2025-outage/[excellent postmortem that they published] was that it wasn't DNS, and it _was_ related, in part, to https://blog.cloudflare.com/18-november-2025-outage/#the-query-behaviour-change[unexpected/unforeseen results from a SQL query].
* There were some https://www.p99conf.io/[excellent talks at P99 Conf] this year, including:

* The https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar[Thoughtworks TechRadar] was updated recently.
I find it interesting as a snapshot of how technologies ebb and flow in their use and adoption (in the ecosystem within which Thoughtworks operates).
I published link:/2025/11/05/tech-radar-nov-2025-data-blips/[a very short summary of the relevant data entries from the radar].

== AI

_I warned you link:/2025/09/30/interesting-links-september-2025/#_ai[previously]…this AI stuff is here to stay, and it'd be short-sighted to think otherwise._
_As I read and learn more about it, I'm going to share interesting links (the clue is in the blog post title) that I find—whilst trying to avoid the breathless hype and slop._

* David Aronchick writes about the brutal reality gap between the vendors and the folk on the ground just trying to get shit done, in this insightful article: https://www.distributedthoughts.org/while-everyone-demos-ai-agents-engineers-fighting-syslogs/[Two KubeCons, One Conference: While Everyone Demos AI Agents, Engineers Are Fighting With Syslogs]
* Thanks to LLM, StackOverflow is dead, long live Reddit! (I am paraphrasing; you can read the full paper with all the nuances and context here: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11074245/[The consequences of generative AI for online knowledge communities])

=== AI in the Enterprise

* Details of AI/ML platforms from https://eng.lyft.com/lyftlearn-evolution-rethinking-ml-platform-architecture-547de6c950e1[Lyft],
https://medium.com/pinterest-engineering/a-decade-of-ai-platform-at-pinterest-4e3b37c0f758[Pinterest],
and https://netflixtechblog.com/supercharging-the-ml-and-ai-development-experience-at-netflix-b2d5b95c63eb[Netflix]
* In an article that does what it says on the tin, Andrey Chubin goes through some of the https://towardsdatascience.com/critical-mistakes-companies-make-when-integrating-ai-ml-into-their-processes/[critical mistakes that companies make when integrating AI/ML into their processes].
* Like the previous article in the list here, this one from Dr. Janna Lipenkova is a look at the _actual_ implementation of AI in a company - to the title of the article, https://towardsdatascience.com/it-doesnt-need-to-be-a-chatbot/[It Doesn’t Need to Be a Chatbot]

=== Data for AI

* A detailed article from Lak Lakshmanan considering https://ai.gopubby.com/what-it-means-to-get-your-data-ready-for-ai-518861a8f025[how data engineering patterns might change as we store and prepare data for use by Agents in the future].
* Dmitry Pavlov describes https://clickhouse.com/blog/ai-first-data-warehouse[how Clickhouse made their internal data warehouse "AI-first"].

=== Coding with AI

* Gergely Orosz (a.k.a The Pragmatic Engineer) chatted with Martin Fowler about https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/martin-fowler[how AI will change software engineering.]
* AI really does open Pandora's box of new vectors for attack, which coupled with the race for development and adoption makes for a potent mix.
Simon Willison has https://simonw.substack.com/p/new-prompt-injection-papers-agents[a good explanation of some of the prompt injection attacks].
* Proving the above point, Anthropic have written up https://www.anthropic.com/news/disrupting-AI-espionage[details of an attack that used Agentic AI].

=== Agents and MCP
