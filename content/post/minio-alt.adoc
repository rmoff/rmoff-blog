In late 2025 the company behind MinIO https://github.com/minio/object-browser/pull/3509[decided] https://github.com/minio/minio/issues/21647#issuecomment-3418675115[to] https://github.com/minio/minio/commit/27742d469462e1561c776f88ca7a1f26816d69e2[abandon] it to pursue other commercial interests.
As well as upsetting a bunch of folk, it also put the cat amongst the pigeons of many software demos that relied on MinIO to provide S3-compatible local storage, not to mention build pipelines that used it for validating S3 compatibility.

In this blog post I'm going to look at some alternatives to MinIO.

<!--more-->

Whilst MinIO is a lot more than 'just' a glorified tool for emulating S3 when building demos, my focus here is going to be on what is the _simplest_ replacement.
In practice that means the following:

* *Must* have a Docker image.
    * So many demos are shipped as Docker Compose, and no-one likes brewing their own Docker images unless _really_ necessary.
* *Must* provide S3 compatibility
    * The whole point of MinIO in these demos is to stand-in for writing to actual S3.
* *Must* be free to use, with a strong preference for Open-Source (per OSI definition) licence e.g. Apache 2.0.
    * OSS projects are unlikely to use a replacement for MinIO that is not also OSS
* Should be **simple** to use for a *single node deployment*;
* Should have a clear and active community and/or commercial backer.
    * Any fule can vibe-code some abandon-ware slop, or fork a project in a fit of enthusiasm—but MinIO stood the test of time until now and we don't want to be repeating this exercise in six months time.
* Bonus points for excellent developer experience (DX), smoother configuration, good docs, etc.

What I'm *not* looking at is, for example, distributed storage, production licence requirements (although OSS would negate this point), GUI, and so on.
That is, this blog post is not aimed at folk who were using MinIO as self-managed S3 in production.
Feel free to leave a comment below though if you have useful things to add in this respect :)

== Baseline project

My starting point for this is a very simple stack: DuckDB to read and write Iceberg data that's stored on S3, provided by MinIO to start with.

image::/images/2026/01/minio01.excalidraw.png[]

When I insert data into DuckDB:

[source,sql]
----
INSERT INTO iceberg_catalog.demo.users VALUES
    (1, 'Alice', 'alice@example.com', CURRENT_TIMESTAMP),
    (2, 'Bob', 'bob@example.com', CURRENT_TIMESTAMP),
    (3, 'Charlie', 'charlie@example.com', CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);
----

it ends up in Iceberg format on S3, here in MinIO:

[source,bash]
----
$ mc ls minio/warehouse/demo/users/data/

----

The Docker Compose is pretty straightforward:

1. DuckDB, obviously, along with Iceberg REST Catalog
2. MinIO (S3 local storage)
3. `mc`, which is a MinIO CLI and used to automagically create a bucket for the data.

In the next sections I'll explore the different alternatives, and how easy they are to switch out MinIO for.

== https://rustfs.com/[RustFS]

Git: https://github.com/rustfs/rustfs

Version tested: `1.0.0-alpha.79`

NOTE: Be aware that there was recently a https://github.com/rustfs/rustfs/security/advisories/GHSA-h956-rh7x-ppgj[pretty bad security vuln] found in RustFS, which has put some people off from using it.
The website looks pretty smart but several links resolve to the same page, giving it that "fresh paint" smell of a new project :)
This might matter less for demos (particularly if it's easy to switch out), and MinIO had such a hold on this space that probably any suitable replacement is going to be equally new.

* ✅ Licence: https://docs.rustfs.com/developer/license.html[Apache 2.0]
* ✅ https://docs.rustfs.com/features/s3-compatibility/[S3 compatibility]

RustFS' own documents suggest using MinIO's `mc` (since an S3 endpoint is just an S3 endpoint, whether MinIO or RustFS), so I'm going to retain that here.

Ease of deployment: 😵

I had to get https://code.claude.com/docs/en/overview[a friend] to help me with this one.
As well as the `garage` container, I needed another to do the initial configuration, as well as a TOML config file which I've inlined in the Docker Compose to keep things concise.

image::/images/2026/01/garage.excalidraw.png[]

Could I have sat down and RTFM'd to figure it out myself? Yes.
Do I have better things to do with my time? Damn right I do.

So, Garage _does_ work, but gosh…it is _not_ just a drop-in replacement in terms of code changes.
It requires different plumbing for initialisation, and it's not simple at that either.
A simple example: `The specified key ID is not a valid Garage key ID (starts with GK, followed by 12 hex-encoded bytes)`.
Excellent for production hygiene…overkill for local demos, and in fact somewhat of a hindrance TBH.

Is this an entirely fair assessment?
If I were looking at it as a new piece of technology in its own right, completely not!
Many pieces of excellent technology, particularly those that can support running distributed, will have a steep learning curve for configuration.
However, my requirement here is a _simple_ drop-in replacement for MinIO—which Garage is not.

Ease of deployment: 👍

https://github.com/seaweedfs/seaweedfs/wiki/Quick-Start-with-weed-mini[This quickstart] is useful for getting bare-minimum S3 functionality working.
(That said, I still just got Claude to do the implementation…).
Overall there's not too much to change here; a fairly straightforward switchout of Docker images, but the auth does need its own config file (which as with Garage, I inlined in the Docker Compose).

SeaweedFS comes with its own basic UI which is handy:

image::/images/2026/01/seaweedfs-ui.png[]

The SeaweedFS website is surprisingly sparse and at a glance you'd be forgiven for missing that it's an OSS project, since there's a "pricing" option and the title of the front page is "SeaweedFS Enterprise".
But an OSS project it is, and a long-established one: SeaweedFS has been around with S3 support since its https://github.com/seaweedfs/seaweedfs/blob/master/LICENSE[0.91 release in 2018].
You can also learn more about SeaweedFS from these conference talk https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1tdkp45J01oRV68dIm4yoTXKJDof-EhainlA0LMXexQE/edit?slide=id.p#slide=id.p[slides], including a https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1tdkp45J01oRV68dIm4yoTXKJDof-EhainlA0LMXexQE/edit?slide=id.g3593a652b55_0_473#slide=id.g3593a652b55_0_473[comparison chart with MinIO].

Ozone was spun out of Apache Hadoop (remember that?) https://apache.org/foundation/records/minutes/2020/board_minutes_2020_10_21.txt[in 2020], having been initially created as part of the HDFS project back in 2015.

It does work as a replacement for MinIO, but it is not a lightweight alternative; Neither I nor Claude could figure out how to deploy it with any fewer than **four** nodes.
It gives heavy Hadoop vibes, and I wouldn't be rushing to adopt it for my usecase here.

Formerly known as S3 Server, CloudServer is part of a toolset called Zenko, published by Scality.
It drops in to replace MinIO pretty easily, but I did find it slightly tricky at first to disentangle the set of names (cloudserver/zenko/scality) and what the actual software I needed to run was.
There's also a slightly odd feel that the docs link to an outdated Docker image.

Very easy to implement, and seems like a nice lightweight option.
One thing I did notice was this one of the projects that it uses, https://jclouds.apache.org/[jclouds], is retired.

== https://docs.ceph.com/en/reef/radosgw/#object-gateway[Ceph Object Gateway]

I took one look at the https://docs.ceph.com/en/reef/cephadm/install/#requirements[installation instructions] and noped right out of this one.
Ozone (above) is heavyweight enough; I'm sure both are great at what they do, but they are not a lightweight container to slot into my Docker Compose stack for local demos.

Would I use it?

RustFS - probably, but is it dodgy?
Garage - no, too complex for what I need
SeaweedFS - yes, long history, established project. Solo contributor tho?
Apache Ozone - fuck no
CloudServer - yes, maybe? not convinced.
S3Proxy - yes. History & contribs tho?
