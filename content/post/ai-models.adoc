_A link:/categories/stumbling-into-ai[short series] of notes for myself as I learn more about the AI ecosystem as of September 2025._
_The driver for all this is understanding more about Apache Flink's https://github.com/apache/flink-agents[*Flink Agents*] project, and Confluent's https://www.confluent.io/product/streaming-agents/[**Streaming Agents**]._

Having link:/2025/09/04/stumbling-into-ai-part-1mcp/[poked around MCP] and got a broad idea of what it is, I want to next look at Models.
What used to be as simple as "I used AI" actually boils down into several discrete areas, particularly when one starts looking at using LLMs beyond writing link:/images/2025/09/13d0418e1ddd2f60eef260aa512cb2a27aed080a4702fd7f01e73ef7b8ba5c2b.png[a rap about Apache Kafka in the style of Monty Python] and using it to build agents (like the Flink Agents that prompted this exploration in the first place).

== Models (Large Language ones, to be precise)

This is the what it's all about right here.
Large Language Models (LLMs) are what picqued the interest of nerds outside the academic community in 2023 and the broader public a year or so later.
What used to be a "_OMFG have you seen this_" moment is now somewhat passé.
Of _course_ I can ask my computer to write my homework assignment for me.
Of _course_ I can use my phone to explain the nuances of the leg-before-wicket rule in Cricket.

image:/images/2025/09/models1.excalidraw.png[]

Without a model, the whole AI sandcastle collapses.
There are https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_large_language_models[many dozens of LLMs].
The most well-known ones are grouped into families and include https://platform.openai.com/docs/models[GPT], https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/about-claude/models/overview#model-names[Claude], and https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/models[Gemini].
Within these there are different models, such as GPT-5, Claude 4.1, and so on.
Often these models themselves have varients, specific to certain tasks like writing software code, generating images, or understanding audio.

=== Companies

The big companies behind the models include:

* OpenAI (GPT)
* Anthropic (Claude)
* Google (Gemini)
* Meta (Llama)

Srsly tho, I'm not going to even pretend to try and understand how LLMs works.
Just as I couldn't tell you how the CPU in my laptop works, but I know that it's there and _waves hands_ does stuff, the same is true for LLMs.

You give them text, they give you a response.

If you want a really good overview of LLMs, have a look at this excellent talk from one of the OGs in the LLM space, Andrej Karpathy:

{{< youtube zjkBMFhNj_g >}}

=== Hallucinations

One of my favourite descriptions of LLMs likened them to an *over-eager, hungover, intern*.
They can do a lot, and know a lot of the words, but you'd never quite trust what they write.

As LLMs improve, it's less likely you'll get completely BS responses from them, but part of the risk is that they usually express themselves extremely confidently.
Here's what an LLM told me about my home town:

> Ilkley:
>
>  - Known for its stunning lakes (Lythwaite Lake) and the Dung scale viaduct, which provides a breathtaking view of the surrounding landscape.
>  - Has a rich history, including being part of the Lancashire cotton industry in the 1800s.

Sounds plausible, right?
But `Lythwaite Lake` and `Dung scale viaduct` _do not exist_ (nor is there a lake or viaduct near the town).
And https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wars_of_the_Roses[worse], Ilkley is very much in Yorkshire, not Lancashire!

Of course, it's easy to cherry-pick these examples.
If I ask a better model about Ilkley, it is https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilkley[completely right]:

> Ilkley:
>
> - Known for its dramatic moorland (Ilkley Moor) and the Cow and Calf rocks, offering sweeping views over Wharfedale and inspiring the song “On Ilkla Moor Baht ’at.”
> - Has a rich history, from its Roman fort (Olicana) and medieval origins to becoming a Victorian spa town famed for hydrotherapy and elegant architecture.

=== Tokens

The input and output of LLMs is measured—and in many cases, charged—on the basis of _tokens_.

[TIP]
====
Just like the video above explaining how LLMs work, if you want to know about details of tokenisation check out this explainer:

{{< youtube zduSFxRajkE >}}
====

In some cases, the number of words is equivilent to the number of tokens:

[source,bash]
----
$ ttok never gonna give you up
5
----

but often not:

[source,bash]
----
$ ttok apache flink
3
$ ttok supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
11
----

Different LLMs may use different tokenisation too.
You can use the https://github.com/simonw/ttok[ttok] tool (shown above) to explore tokenisation in more detail.
Some tools, such as Goose, will also show you how many tokens are used:

image:/images/2025/09/441a2e716c8ec369ff81988cb0c369a67ffdfd10d292d87bd42d0c3bc65a770a.png[,width=600px]

You'll notice that as well as the token count, there's a dollar amount next to it.
Since I'm running the model locally (using https://ollama.com/[Ollama]) there's no direct cost for the invocation of it.
Where the the token count matters is when you're using remote models, like GPT or Claude.
These are https://platform.openai.com/docs/pricing?latest-pricing=standard#text-tokens[charged] based on the number of tokens used, often listed as a cost per 1M tokens.

Nine tokens might seem like a drop in the ocean of a million, but look at this:

image:/images/2025/09/c4ad35ade6245a62812b3aa3026cd7e2765c76d781b2d08339bbbfa0923e8596.png[]

The same input prompt (`supercalifragilisticexpialidocious`) but somehow I just used nearly 10k tokens!
If you read my link:/2025/09/04/stumbling-into-ai-part-1mcp/[blog post about MCP] you'll know that LLMs can make use of MCP servers (often generically referred to as "tools" or "extensions").
They can be used to look up further information to support the user's request ("_what films have they rated the highest_"), or even invoke actions ("_book two tickets at the local cinema to see Top Gun on Monday at 8pm_").
So when I gave the agent the prompt `supercalifragilisticexpialidocious`, what it actually did was include information about all of the tools configured, so that the LLM could choose to use them or not—and this took up a lot of tokens, because there were several tools configured.

So if I disable the tools/MCP servers, the token count should be back to just that of the input expression?

image:/images/2025/09/1cb6fa8178df3c00a5e73f57459124f2afee02714fc43659881fd2baf3dde655.png[]

Not so.
And that's because most of the time you use an LLM you're doing so with a particular purpose or framing, and so a _system prompt_ will help focus it on what you want it to do.

For example, here is the same input, but with two different system prompts.

[source,bash]
----
$ echo "Internet" | \                                         <1>
    llm -m gpt-oss:latest \
        -s "Define this word. Be concise."                    <2>
**Internet** – a global network of interconnected computers that exchange data using standardized protocols, enabling communication, information sharing, and services across the world.

$ echo "Internet" | \                                         <1>
    llm -m gpt-oss:latest \
        -s "Define this word to a five year old. Be concise." <2>
The internet is like a giant invisible playground for computers. It lets them share pictures, videos, games, and messages so you can learn, play, and talk to friends from anywhere.
----
<1> User input
<2> System prompt

Ultimately the system prompt is just a bunch of tokens that get passed to the LLM; and that's probably what we're seeing in the screenshot above where the token count is higher than that of the input text alone.

==== Why does this matter?

Because someone has to pay for all this fun, and how many tokens you use determines how much you'll pay.
You might be using the LLM provider's API directly and thus directly exposed to the token cost, or you might be using a tool whose authoring company pays the API bills and in turn will cap your invocation through the tool at a certain point.
You might think a million tokens sounds a lot, but this can easily get burnt through with things like:
* MCP usage, in which the output from an API call might be a long JSON document - and often multiple API calls will get strung together to satisfy a single user request
* Coding help, when the LLM will have to be given reams of code across potentially many files

==== Context Window

When you interact with an LLM, it can 'remember' what you've told it—and what it's told you—before.
This is called the context window, and is measured in tokens.
It's not always exposed by the AI tool.

=== Weights & Parameters

After many years working with open source software, I was puzzled by the new terminology that I started to hear in relation to LLMs: "Open Weight".

In terms of software alone, open source has https://opensource.org/osd[a strict set of definitions], but one of the key ones from an end-user point of view is that I can access all the source code and in theory could build the program from scratch myself.

When it comes to LLMs it's not quite so straightforward.
Watching https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjkBMFhNj_g[Andrej Karpathy's video] I've picked up the basic understanding that you've got the mega-expensive pre-training in which vast swathes of the internet and beyond are boiled down into a model.
He https://youtu.be/zjkBMFhNj_g?feature=shared&t=258[gives the example] of Llama 2 costing $2M and taking 12 days to train.
The size of the model is defined by the number of parameters.
Broadly, the greater the number of parameters, the greater the accuracy of the LLM.
Fewer parameters means less computing power needed and potentially less accurate results—but depending on what you're asking the LLM to do can sometimes be a good tradeoff.

Out of this pre-training is then a core model which is then trained further in what's known as fine-tuning.
This is cheaper, and faster, to do.
It can be used to specialise the model towards particular tasks or domains.

Companies approach the sharing of models in different ways.
Some keep absolutely everything to themselves, giving the end user simply an API endpoint or web page with which to interact with the model that they've built.
Other will perhaps share the pre-trained model (but not the source data or code that went into training it), giving people the opportunity to then train it further with their own fine-tuning.
This is the "Open Weight" approach.

You can read more about https://ai.meta.com/blog/llama-4-multimodal-intelligence/[Llama 4] and https://ai.meta.com/research/publications/the-llama-3-herd-of-models/[Llama 3] on the Meta AI blog.
This post on Reddit is also interesting: https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1iw1xn7/the_paradox_of_open_weights_but_closed_source/[The Paradox of Open Weights, but Closed Source]

== Clients

OK, so we've got our models.
They come in different shapes and sizes, and some are better than others.

To use an LLM, one needs a client.
Clients take various forms:

* Desktop and Web clients, specific to the AI company developing a family of LLMs.
These include https://chatgpt.com/[ChatGPT] and https://claude.ai/download[Claude].
+
image:/images/2025/09/claudeandchatgpt.png[]
* Tools built around AI functionality (e.g. Cursor) or with it bolted on whether you want it or not (_i.e. every bloody application out there these days_ 😜).
Some of these will give you access to a set of models, whilst others will mask the model itself and just call it +++<del>+++"magic"+++</del>+++"AI"
