Whilst Apache Kafka is an event streaming platform designed for, well, _streams_ of events, it's perfectly valid to use it as a store of data which perhaps changes only occasionally (or even never). I'm thinking here of reference data (lookup data) that's used to enrich regular streams of events. 

You might well get your reference data from a database where it resides and do so effectively https://rmoff.dev/no-more-silos[using CDC] - but sometimes it comes down to those pesky CSV files that we all know and love/hate. Simple, awful, but effective. I wrote previously about link:/2020/06/17/loading-csv-data-into-kafka/[loading CSV data into Kafka from files that are updated frequently], but here I want to look at CSV files that are not changing. Kafka Connect simplifies getting data in to (and out of) Kafka but even Kafka Connect becomes a bit of an overhead when you just have a single file that you want to load into a topic and then never deal with again. I spent this afternoon wrangling with a couple of CSV-ish files, and building on my previous article about link:/2021/02/02/performing-a-group-by-on-data-in-bash/[neat tricks you can do in bash with data], I have some more to share with you here :)

== The data

The first file has two fields and is semi-colon delimited: 

[source,bash]
----
$ cat data01.csv
shipname;mmsi
FRIO FORWIN;210631000
AQUAMARINE;214182223
OCEAN STAR 98;214182700
MINIK ARCTICA;219663000
IVALO ARCTICA;219667000
IZAR ARGIA;224434000
V CENTENARIO;224739000
MARINERO2;238187240
SANTINA;256384000
----

The second has more fields, and is comma-separated. There is a common field in both files (`mmsi`) and this will be important later.

== The requirement

I'm using the data from both these files to enrich a stream of data about the movement of ships, based on the `mmsi` field as a key. I want to load both datasets into separate topics, with the `mmsi` field set as the key in both. 

== The solution - tl;dr

Whilst I could use Kafka Connect connectors for ingesting flat files into Kafka such as `kafka-connect-spooldir` and `kafka-connect-filepulse`, I wanted something dead simple. Since the data wasn't changing I didn't want to get into setting up connectors, and quick & dirty would be just fine. 

The short answer here is `kafkacat`, which takes `stdin` as a source of messages for writing to Kafka. It can be given a delimiter to split the input into key and value for writing to Kafka.

The slightly longer answer is a few other bash tools for manipulating the data into an appropriate state for `kafkacat` to receive. 

== The solution - in detail

=== Switching fields around in bash

The first file, `data01.csv`, has the `mmsi` field second, and I want the first so that I can use it as the key when it gets to kafkacat. For that we can use `awk`: 

[source,bash]
----
awk -F";" '{ print $2 "," $1 }' data01.csv
----

Or…we _think_ we can. Because this was where the fun started. Check this out. What should happen is that with the field separator set to `;` awk will store the first field in `$1` and second in `$2`, which I can then just reverse in the `print` output. But what happens is this: 

[source,bash]
----
awk -F";" '{ print $2 "," $1 }' data01.csv
,shipname
,FRIO FORWIN
,AQUAMARINE
,OCEAN STAR 98
----

Huh? I get the new field separator (a comma), and the the first field (`$1`) -- but not the second. Weird. Let's see if `$2` is working: 

[source,bash]
----
awk -F";" '{ print $2 }' data01.csv
mmsi
210631000
214182223
214182700
----

Yup, that field is working too - so why aren't they working together? 

=== When is a line break different from a line break?

After a lot of headscratching, and a _lot_ of Google and StackOverflow, I hit on the problem. 

image::/images/2021/02/lineendings.png[]

The file was written with `/x0d /x0a` (CRLF) line endings, which was screwing things up. I don't actually know why (https://twitter.com/rmoff/[drop me a line if you do!]) but once I stripped the `CR` (`\r`) them out with `tr` things started to look better: 

[source,bash]
----
$ tr -d '\r' < data01.csv |awk -F";" ' { print $2 "," $1 }'
mmsi,shipname
210631000,FRIO FORWIN
214182223,AQUAMARINE
214182700,OCEAN STAR 98
----

=== Setting a key separator / Inserting hex values with awk

I've link:/2020/09/30/setting-key-value-when-piping-from-jq-to-kafkacat/[written before] about a little trick for manipulating data from `jq` piped to `kafkacat` such that a key is set in the resulting Kafka message. I wanted to use the same approach here. It relies on putting a character between the key and value part of the data, and picking a character that isn't going to appear elsewhere in the payload. I used https://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/001c/index.htm[`\x1c`] here. 

To use it as the separator between the two fields in awk looks like this - I'm piping it to `hexdump` so that you can see its effect: 

[source,bash]
----
$ tr -d '\r' < data01.csv | awk -F";" ' { print $2 "\x1c" $1 } '| hexdump -C
00000000  6d 6d 73 69 1c 73 68 69  70 6e 61 6d 65 0a 32 31  |mmsi.shipname.21|
00000010  30 36 33 31 30 30 30 1c  46 52 49 4f 20 46 4f 52  |0631000.FRIO FOR|
00000020  57 49 4e 0a 32 31 34 31  38 32 32 32 33 1c 41 51  |WIN.214182223.AQ|
00000030  55 41 4d 41 52 49 4e 45  0a 32 31 34 31 38 32 37  |UAMARINE.2141827|
00000040  30 30 1c 4f 43 45 41 4e  20 53 54 41 52 20 39 38  |00.OCEAN STAR 98|
----

Now we're ready to stream the data to Kafka, specifying this special character as the key separator to `kafkacat`: 

[source,bash]
----
tr -d '\r' < data01.csv | \
  awk -F";" ' { print $2 "\x1c" $1 } '| \
  kafkacat -b localhost:9092 -t data01 -K$'\x1c' -P
----

We can consume the data from the Kafka topic with `kafkacat` to check that it's worked: 

[source,bash]
----
$ kafkacat \
        -b localhost:9092 \
        -C -o beginning -u \
        -t data01 \
        -f 'Topic+Partition+Offset: %t+%p+%o\tKey: %k\tValue: %s\n'
Topic+Partition+Offset: data01+0+0      Key: mmsi       Value: shipname
Topic+Partition+Offset: data01+0+1      Key: 210631000  Value: FRIO FORWIN
Topic+Partition+Offset: data01+0+2      Key: 214182223  Value: AQUAMARINE
Topic+Partition+Offset: data01+0+3      Key: 214182700  Value: OCEAN STAR 98
----

_NOTE: The CSV header line has been ingested as a data row; if we were fussed we could filter it out prior to ingest with `head`._

So: one file down, one to go. The second one is a bit more tricky because we've got more fields to deal with. I don't really want to start writing `awk` statements with a long list of field numbers and separators, so let's see how we can do it a bit smarter. 

=== Changing the first comma in a CSV file in bash

Unlike the previous file, the key field (`mmsi`) _is_ the first field in this file so we don't need to reorder things. 

[source,bash]
----
head data02.csv
mmsi,shipname,callsign,flag,imo,first_timestamp,last_timestamp
306117000,SIERRALAUREL,PJBQ,ANT,9163403,2018-03-29T08:34:21Z,2018-06-30T17:08:41Z

309681,GREENBRAZIL,C6WH6,BHS,9045792,2018-06-29T10:34:00Z,2018-06-30T23:47:40Z
----

We do, however, want to change the comma into our bespoke key/value delimiter. This time I reached for `sed` (although if there's one thing I learnt from my afternoon of Googling is that `sed` and `awk` and always `perl` usually can be twisted to perform the same function). 

In `sed` the very common usage is to change one thing for another—so much so that it's become shorthand amongst nerds when reviewing documents to report a tyop (`s/tyop/typo`) -- see what I did there? ;-) 

So, with `sed` if you specify a trailing `/g` in the replacement expression then all matches are replaced: 

[source,bash]
----
$ echo 'one_two_three' | sed 's/_/ FOO /g'
one FOO two FOO three
----

Without the trailing `/g` only the first match is replaced: 

[source,bash]
----
$ echo 'one_two_three' | sed 's/_/ FOO /'
one FOO two_three
----

So we can use this to replace the first comma (after our key field), whilst leaving the others alone. As before we needed to strip out the `CR` characters in the line breaks with `tr`: 

[source,bash]
----
$ tr -d '\r' < data02.csv|sed 's/,/ FOO /'
mmsi FOO shipname,callsign,flag,imo,first_timestamp,last_timestamp
306117000 FOO SIERRALAUREL,PJBQ,ANT,9163403,2018-03-29T08:34:21Z,2018-06-30T17:08:41Z
306873000 FOO SIERRALEYRE,PJJZ,ANT,9135822,2012-01-01T01:06:00Z,2012-06-26T08:58:28Z

----

Now all we need to do is replace ` FOO ` with a single-character hex value that we can use for the key delimiter in `kafkacat`. And this was where it got sticky. 

=== Using a hex value in the replacement argument of `sed`

I started off with the fairly obvious, which didn't work - I just got a literal `x1c` value: 

[source,bash]
----
$ tr -d '\r' < data02.csv|sed 's/,/\x1c/'

All that Google wanted to tell me was how to _replace_ a hex value with `sed`, rather than use hex *in the replacement*. Eventually I found https://stackoverflow.com/a/28059344/350613[this answer on StackOverflow] which set me on the right lines - using `$(printf '\x1c')` (and because that uses single quotes, change the sed expression to be surrounded by double quotes)

[source,bash]
----
tr -d '\r' < data02.csv|sed "s/,/$(printf '\x1c')/"|hexdump -C

So after this I ended up with 

[source,bash]

tr -d '\r' < data02.csv | \
  sed  "s/,/$(printf '\x1c')/" | \

Which worked a treat and loaded the data which looked like this once loaded: 

[source,bash]

        -b localhost:9092 \
        -C -o beginning -u \

== Using the data

So, whilst my explanations may have been verbose, the actual result was relatively simple. With the data loaded into Kafka topics I could fire up ksqlDB (in which I was doing the stream processing) and define a table over each topic. The key (!!) thing with tables is that the Kafka message key must be the key declared in the table—which is why we did that extra work above at ingest time.  

[source,sql]
----
CREATE TABLE data01 (mmsi BIGINT PRIMARY KEY, shipname_raw varchar) 
  WITH (KAFKA_TOPIC='data01', FORMAT='DELIMITED');

CREATE TABLE data02 (mmsi BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,shipname VARCHAR,callsign VARCHAR,flag VARCHAR,imo VARCHAR,first_timestamp VARCHAR,last_timestamp VARCHAR)
  WITH (KAFKA_TOPIC='data02', FORMAT='DELIMITED');
----

And with the tables defined, I could query them: 

[source,sql]
----
