Short & sweet to help out future Googlers. Trying to use `abcde` I got the error: 

[source,bash]
----
[WARNING] something went wrong while querying the CD... Maybe a DATA CD or the CD is not loaded?
[WARNING] Error trying to calculate disc ids without lead-out information.

Google found me https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/406147/unable-to-read-an-audio-cd-in-debian-9-2[this StackOverflow article] which ultimately ended with the OP having a faulty drive, but courtesy of a well-written question I got this snippet to try: 

[source,bash]
----
cd-info /dev/sr0
----

which gave me

[source,bash]
----
cd-info version 2.0.0 x86_64-redhat-linux-gnu

So it was a permissions error for me, fixed by adding my userid to the `cdrom` group thus: 

[source,bash]
----
sudo usermod -a -G cdrom rmoff
----

After logging out and back in again, `cd-info` worked:

[source,bash]
----
cd-info /dev/sr0

as did `abcde`:

I could have fiddled around with `usermod` and groups and stuff like that, but `chmod` was quicker & as effective on my simple home server. YOLO `¯\\_(ツ)_/¯`
