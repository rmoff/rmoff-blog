https://github.com/edenhill/kafkacat[kafkacat] is one of my go-to tools when working with Kafka. It's a producer and consumer, but also a swiss-army knife of debugging and troubleshooting capabilities. So when I built a new Fedora server recently, I needed to get it installed. Unfortunately there's no pre-packed install available on `yum`, so here's how to do it manually. 

NOTE: `kafkacat` is now known as `kcat` (https://github.com/edenhill/kcat/pull/339[ref]). When invoking the command you will need to use *`kcat`* in place of `kafkacat`.

== Pre-requisite installs

We'll need some packages from the Confluent repo so set this up for `yum` first by creating `/etc/yum.repos.d/confluent.repo`: 

{{< highlight shell >}}
[Confluent.dist]
name=Confluent repository (dist)
baseurl=https://packages.confluent.io/rpm/5.4/7
gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=https://packages.confluent.io/rpm/5.4/archive.key
enabled=1

[Confluent]
name=Confluent repository
baseurl=https://packages.confluent.io/rpm/5.4
gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=https://packages.confluent.io/rpm/5.4/archive.key
enabled=1
{{< /highlight >}}

Now install the dependencies: 

{{< highlight shell >}}
# Update yum
sudo yum update -y

# Install build tools 
sudo yum group install "Development Tools" -y

# Install librdkafka and other deps
sudo yum install -y librdkafka-devel yajl-devel avro-c-devel
{{< /highlight >}}

== Build kafkacat

Pull down the kafkacat repo: 

{{< highlight shell >}}
git clone https://github.com/edenhill/kafkacat.git
cd kafkacat
{{< /highlight >}}

Prepare the install - make sure that this step does not result in an error! 

{{< highlight shell >}}
./configure
{{< /highlight >}}

If you get errors here, it's off to Google you go to try and figure them out, because there's no point continuing if you can't. You might find some `failed` steps that don't result in an actual error - this is a "soft fail" and means that certain functionality won't be available in the kafkacat that you install (in this case, Avro/Schema Registry). Here's an example of one: 

{{< highlight shell >}}
checking for serdes (by pkg-config)... failed
checking for serdes (by compile)... failed (disable)
{{< /highlight >}}

== Install!

{{< highlight shell >}}
make
sudo make install
{{< /highlight >}}

Check that it works: 

{{< highlight shell >}}
➜ kafkacat -V

== This all seems like too much hassle? 

Yeah, that's why Docker was invented ;-)

If you want to run kafkacat but can't get it installed, do not fear! You can run it anyway: 

{{< highlight shell >}}
docker run --rm edenhill/kafkacat:1.5.0 \
    kafkacat -V
{{< /highlight >}}

You just need to make sure you wrap your head around Docker networking if you do this, because `localhost` to a Docker container is not the same (by default) as `localhost` on your host machine:

{{< highlight shell >}}
➜ docker run --rm edenhill/kafkacat:1.5.0 \
    kafkacat -b localhost:29092 -L
% ERROR: Failed to acquire metadata: Local: Broker transport failure
{{< /highlight >}}

If you add `--network=host` then it will use the network as if executing locally: 

{{< highlight shell >}}
➜ docker run --rm --network=host edenhill/kafkacat:1.5.0 \
    kafkacat -b localhost:29092 -L

Metadata for all topics (from broker 3: localhost:29092/3):
 3 brokers:
  broker 2 at localhost:19092
  broker 3 at localhost:29092 (controller)
  broker 1 at localhost:9092
{{< /highlight >}}
