== kafkacat gives you Kafka super powers 😎

I've https://rmoff.net/categories/kafkacat/[written before] about https://github.com/edenhill/kafkacat[kafkacat] and what a great tool it is for doing lots of useful things as a developer with Kafka. I used it too in https://talks.rmoff.net/8Oruwt/on-track-with-apache-kafka-building-a-streaming-etl-solution-with-rail-data#s9tMEWG[a recent demo] that I built in which data needed manipulating in a way that I couldn't easily elsewhere. Today I want share a very simple but powerful use for kafkacat as both a consumer and producer: copying data from one Kafka cluster to another. In this instance it's getting data from https://confluent.cloud/[Confluent Cloud] down to a local cluster. 

<!--more-->

Why would I want to copy data from one Kafka cluster to another? In this instance it was because I had set up a pipeline streaming data into one cluster (on Confluent Cloud) and I needed that data locally so that I could work on building code around it whilst offline. Offline happens less and less often nowadays but it still happens—on many flights, and often at conferences/hotels with "WiFi" that isn't. 

There are several proper ways to replicate data from one Kafka cluster to another, including MirrorMaker (part of Apache Kafka) and https://docs.confluent.io/current/connect/kafka-connect-replicator/index.html[Replicator] (part of Confluent Platform). If what I needed was a proper solution then obviously I'd reach for Replicator—but here I just needed quick & dirty, didn't care about replicating consumer offsets etc.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_(Unix)[Unix pipelines] are a beautiful thing, because they enable you to build fantastically powerful processing out of individual components that each focus on doing their own thing particularly well. kafkacat fully supports the pipelines concept, which means that you can stream data out of a Kafka topic (using kafkacat as a consumer) into any tool that accepts `stdin`, and you can also take data from any tool that produces `stdout` and write it to a Kafka topic (using kafkacat as a producer). 

Guess what happens when you hook up two kafkacat instances, one consuming and one producing? A delightful thing happens; you read from one topic and write to another!

NOTE: This is a hack—I have not tried it (and suspect it wouldn't work) with binary data; that's exactly what https://docs.confluent.io/current/connect/kafka-connect-replicator/index.html[Replicator] and its support for Byte arrays is for :) 

At a very simply level you can do this: 

{{< highlight shell >}}
kafkacat -b localhost:9092 -C -t source-topic -K: -e -o beginning | \
kafkacat -b localhost:9092 -P -t target-topic -K: 
{{< /highlight >}}

That will take every message on `source-topic` and write it to `target-topic` on the same cluster. Some flags: 

* `-K` output/parse keys separated by `:`
* `-e` exit once at the end of the topic

The above will run once, and you get a copy of that topic at the point in time at which the script runs. If you re-run it you'll get another full copy of the data. 

What about if you want to resume consumption after each execution, or even scale it out? kafkacat supports consumer groups!

{{< highlight shell >}}
kafkacat -b localhost:9092 \
    -X auto.offset.reset=earliest \
    -K: \
    -G cg01 source-topic | \
kafkacat -b localhost:9092 -t target-topic -K: -P
{{< /highlight >}}

The arguments are a bit different this time. We replace `-C` (consumer) and specifying the topic with `-t`

    -C -t source-topic

with `-G` to specify using the balanced consumer, its name, and which topic(s) to subscribe to

    -G cg01 source-topic

We also change `-o beginning` for `-X auto.offset.reset=earliest`. When this is run we see the partitions of the six-partition topic that have been assigned to it:

{{< highlight shell >}}
% Group cg01 rebalanced (memberid rdkafka-894c0f84-9464-42dd-b76a-885420b6c557): assigned: source-topic [0], source-topic [1], source-topic [2], source-topic [3], source-topic [4], source-topic [5]
% Reached end of topic source-topic [2] at offset 11
% Reached end of topic source-topic [0] at offset 0
% Reached end of topic source-topic [1] at offset 0
% Reached end of topic source-topic [5] at offset 0
% Reached end of topic source-topic [3] at offset 0
% Reached end of topic source-topic [4] at offset 0
{{< /highlight >}}

and if we run a second instance of it with the same consumer group id both rebalance: 

* Instance 1
+
{{< highlight shell >}}
% Group cg01 rebalanced (memberid rdkafka-894c0f84-9464-42dd-b76a-885420b6c557): assigned: source-topic [3], source-topic [4], source-topic [5]
{{< /highlight >}}

* Instance 2
+
{{< highlight shell >}}
% Group cg01 rebalanced (memberid rdkafka-2416395f-7232-4fc0-8fbc-121d3bbc3758): assigned: source-topic [0], source-topic [1], source-topic [2]
{{< /highlight >}}


== Copying data from Confluent Cloud to a local Kafka cluster

Now let's add Confluent Cloud into the mix—or any other secured Kafka cluster for that matter. We just need a few extra parameters in our call : 

{{< highlight shell >}}
kafkacat -b $CCLOUD_BROKER_HOST \
    -X security.protocol=SASL_SSL -X sasl.mechanisms=PLAIN \
    -X sasl.username="$CCLOUD_API_KEY" -X sasl.password="$CCLOUD_API_SECRET" \
    -X ssl.ca.location=/usr/local/etc/openssl/cert.pem -X api.version.request=true \
    -X auto.offset.reset=earliest \
    -K: \
    -G copy_to_local_00 source-topic  | \
kafkacat -b localhost:9092,localhost:19092,localhost:29092 \
    -t target-topic \
    -K: -P 
{{< /highlight >}}

And off we go. How can we check it's worked? kafkacat of course! We can sample some records: 

{{< highlight shell >}}
$ kafkacat -b localhost:9092 -t source-topic -o beginning -e -C -c 5
{"batt":97,,"acc":200,"p":98.689468383789062,"bs":1,"vel":0,"vac":93,"t":"u","conn":"w","tst":1569316069,"alt":97,"_type":"location","tid":"FF"}
{"cog":193,"batt":45,"acc":16,"p":100.14543914794922,"bs":1,"vel":0,"vac":3,"conn":"w","tst":1569330854,"tid":"RM","_type":"location","alt":104}
{"batt":97,,"acc":200,"p":98.689468383789062,"bs":1,"vel":0,"vac":93,"t":"u","conn":"w","tst":1569316069,"alt":97,"_type":"location","tid":"FF"}
{"cog":193,"batt":45,"acc":16,"p":100.14543914794922,"bs":1,"vel":0,"vac":3,"conn":"w","tst":1569330854,"tid":"RM","_type":"location","alt":104}
{"batt":97,,"acc":200,"p":98.689468383789062,"bs":1,"vel":0,"vac":93,"t":"u","conn":"w","tst":1569316069,"alt":97,"_type":"location","tid":"FF"}
{{< /highlight >}}

and we can count how many are currently in the topic: 

{{< highlight shell >}}
$ kafkacat -b localhost:9092 -t target-topic -o beginning -e|wc -l
% Auto-selecting Consumer mode (use -P or -C to override)
% Reached end of topic target-topic [0] at offset 1668: exiting
    1668
{{< /highlight >}}

We can see the consumer group in Confluent Cloud (with similar views in Confluent Control Center if you're running Apache Kafka for yourself), showing any lag in each consumer:

Like I said above, there are dozens of reasons why you would *not* want to use this, including: 

* No copying of offsets from source to target cluster
* Probably mangles binary data
* Doesn't copy topic properties (partition count, replication factor) from source to target
* Doesn't copy headers
* Hacky as hell!
