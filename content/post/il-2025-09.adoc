Sneaking it in _just_ before the end of the month!

It's a bumper set of links this month—I started with an original backlog of 125 links to get through.
Some fell by the wayside, but plenty of others (78, to be precise) made the cut.
With no further ado, let's get cracking!

_Not got time for all this? I've marked 🔥 for my top reads of the month_ :)

== Data Engineering and Architecture

* Some blog posts don't need to be long.
This, from Lawrence Kesteloot, is one of them.
https://www.teamten.com/lawrence/programming/use-singular-nouns-for-database-table-names.html[Use singular nouns for database table names].
* DuckDB and DuckLake in action in https://developyr.medium.com/the-local-lakehouse-how-i-built-a-production-grade-data-platform-on-my-laptop-508a421efbae[this blog post] from Daniel Wallace
* Simon Späti has published an in-depth https://www.ssp.sh/blog/practical-data-modeling-clickhouse/[Data Modeling Guide for Real-Time Analytics with ClickHouse]
* 🔥 It's all kicked off again in the blogosphere, with Daniel Beach calling out the https://www.confessionsofadataguy.com/the-medallion-architecture-farce/[Medallion Architecture Farce], before pondering whether the architecture itself is https://dataengineeringcentral.substack.com/p/medallion-architecture-truth-or-fiction[Truth or Fiction?].
He also took a moment to raise concerns that https://www.confessionsofadataguy.com/is-data-modeling-dead/[data modeling may be dead].
Ananth Packkildurai posted https://www.dataengineeringweekly.com/p/revisiting-medallion-architecture[a calm and measured analysis] of the architecture, and Joe Reis reminded us that the medallion architecture is https://practicaldatamodeling.substack.com/p/medallion-architecture-is-not-a-data[NOT a Data Model]. I'll even chuck in link:/2022/10/02/data-engineering-in-2022-architectures-terminology/#_reference_architectures[my earlier thoughts on it], in which I draw clear parallels Oracle's reference architecture back in 2013… 😁
+
Meanwhile, Robert Anderson https://medium.com/@rdo.anderson/the-joke-of-data-vault-generation-1ef8c170ce55[shared] his scepticism of Data Vault.
* https://duckdb.org/2025/09/16/announcing-duckdb-140[DuckDB 1.4 was released], and with it the first LTS (Long Term Support) version.
New features include support for writing Apache Iceberg files (see below), `MERGE`, and database encryption.
* Max Gabrielsson discusses the use of https://duckdb.org/2025/08/08/spatial-joins.html[spatial data in DuckDB] and the improvements made to performance of spatial joins in 1.3.
* Getting data from Kafka to Snowflake can be done in several different ways; Emma Amor covers two of them in https://freedium.cfd/https://medium.com/ml-cheat-sheet/building-a-modern-real-time-data-streaming-architecture-two-paths-from-kafka-to-snowflake-135a2520fbbf[this blog post].

== AI

[NOTE]
====
_Wait, what's this? A new section this month, all about AI?_
_Is Robin now drinking the hype-juice too?_

Don't worry, this isn't a rebranding of `rmoff.net` to `ai-ai-ai-vc-money.plz` (at least not yet).
Whilst I've been an avid user _of_ AI for some time now (mostly through link:/categories/raycast/[Raycast]'s AI features), I've started to take an interest in understanding it in more detail.
This month I wrote up a few note-taking articles as I learn more about link:/2025/09/04/stumbling-into-ai-part-1mcp/[MCP], link:/2025/09/08/stumbling-into-ai-part-2models/[Models], link:/2025/09/12/stumbling-into-ai-part-3rag/[RAG], and link:/2025/09/16/stumbling-into-ai-part-4terminology-tidy-up-and-a-little-rant/[some general rambling and corrections].

**AI is important, and it's here to stay.**
To the nay-sayers who scoff at the errors it makes and laugh at the idea that it can do our jobs…you are missing the point.
Some of the attitudes I've encountered give me heavy vibes of Oracle DBAs 15 years ago who derided the idea of "The Cloud".
That came to pass, completely upending how we build things—and so will AI.
(We'll ignore Blockchain for now…not every hype turns into reality 😉).

🔥 Sam Newman https://www.linkedin.com/posts/samnewman_to-those-of-you-who-are-deeply-pessimistic-activity-7373683325925900288-gFqC/[posted an excellent note] on LinkedIn, which begins:

> To those of you who are deeply pessimistic around the use of AI in software delivery, the old quote from John Maynard Keynes comes to mind:
>
> _**"The market can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent".**_

Go read the rest of the post (it's not long).
In addition, Scott Werner's article 🔥 https://worksonmymachine.ai/p/the-only-skill-that-matters-now[The Only Skill That Matters Now] puts it even more clearly into focus, with a nice analogy about how "skating to the puck" is no longer a viable strategy (tl;dr the rate of change in AI means you have no idea where the puck will even be).

The impact of AI going to be felt universally.
Here are some interesting articles that I've come across this month about it in the sphere of data:

* A paper titled https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.00997[Supporting Our AI Overlords: Redesigning Data Systems to be Agent-First] discussing the ways in which LLMs want to retrieve data and how we might change how we model data to support that.
Murat Demirbas has a nice https://muratbuffalo.blogspot.com/2025/09/supporting-our-ai-overlords-redesigning.html[analysis and commentary] on the paper.
* A summary of a presentation given by Xintong Song on the new https://freedium.cfd/https://medium.com/@Joannahe/flink-agents-an-event-driven-ai-agent-framework-based-on-apache-flink-45688be46dad[Flink Agents] project (a formal sub-project of Apache Flink itself)
* MCP servers are a nice way to provide standard interoperability between LLMs and other computer systems.
I've not these ones out specifically but the idea of being able to chat to Claude about https://github.com/cledar/flink-mcp[Flink], https://github.com/kanapuli/mcp-kafka[Kafka], and https://github.com/confluentinc/mcp-confluent[Confluent Cloud] certainly sounds a cool idea :)
* A https://www.pedronasc.com/articles/lessons-building-ai-data-analyst[good account] from Pedro Nascimento of why what sounds like a simple enough idea ("build an AI-powered data analyst") is a lot more complex than you may think.

== Iceberg (and other OTF/Data Lake stuff)

_I mean, there may be some Delta Lake, Hudi, and DuckLake in here…but in my corner of the internet it's Iceberg all the way…_

* https://github.com/apache/iceberg/releases/tag/apache-iceberg-1.10.0[Apache Iceberg 1.10] was released
* DuckDB's support for writing to Iceberg is covered by https://freedium.cfd/https://medium.com/@neuw84/iceberg-on-duckdb-end-to-end-example-with-amazon-s3-tables-5506e8537b33[Angel Conde] and https://freedium.cfd/https://dwickyferi.medium.com/writing-iceberg-tables-with-duckdb-1-4-0-a-practical-starter-guide-54d6da4c4bce[Dwicky Feri].

* https://duckdb.org/2025/09/17/ducklake-03.html[DuckLake 0.3] was released, including support for copying to and from Iceberg.
* There are several interesting Iceberg performance articles, including a https://freedium.cfd/https://overcast.blog/11-apache-iceberg-optimization-tools-you-should-know-5b43211aac65[grab-bag of 11 tools and tips], discussion from Vincent Daniel of the https://freedium.cfd/https://medium.com/@vincent_daniel/boost-iceberg-performance-and-cut-compute-costs-with-well-scoped-merge-statements-e0a8f702c321[`MERGE` statement], and a write-up from Ancestry on their https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/how-ancestry-optimizes-a-100-billion-row-iceberg-table/[optimisation of a 100-billion row Iceberg table].

This is something I spent some time looking at https://lakefs.io/blog/data-engineering-patterns-write-audit-publish/[in the past] too, and still think is a good data engineering pattern to draw on.
* Jeffrey Jonathan Jennings has a nice hands-on example of deploying a platform of https://freedium.cfd/https://thej3.com/confluent-trifecta-kafka-flink-iceberg-ae7bf8beb46f[Kafka, Flink, and Iceberg with Confluent Cloud].

* 🔥 A well-written and spicy take from WarpStream's Richie Artoul on https://www.warpstream.com/blog/the-case-for-an-iceberg-native-database-why-spark-jobs-and-zero-copy-kafka-wont-cut-it[getting data from Kafka into Iceberg] and where he sees some of the proposals from the community as flawed.
* On the admin side of things, Nimtable's https://github.com/nimtable/iceberg-compaction[compaction runtime] for Iceberg has been released (open source/Apache 2.0), and Apache Amoro claim https://freedium.cfd/https://medium.com/@jinsong.zhou1990/10x-efficiency-boost-compared-to-spark-rewritefiles-procedure-how-apache-amoro-efficiently-7e7a993950d7[10x performance improvements] from their table maintenance feature.
