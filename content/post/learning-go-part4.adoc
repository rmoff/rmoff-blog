üëâ https://tour.golang.org/moretypes/25[A Tour of Go : Function Closures]

So far the Tour has been ü§î and üßê and even ü§® but function closures had me ü§Ø ‚Ä¶

Each of the words on the page made sense but strung together in a sentence didn't really make any sense to me.

Google resources threw up some nice explanations: 

* https://gobyexample.com/closures
+
I like this site as it links all its examples to https://play.golang.org/p/66Lgw9iIIch[The Go Playground] where you can try out each code block
* http://tleyden.github.io/blog/2016/12/20/understanding-function-closures-in-go/
+
This comment was particularly useful
+
> Essentially you can think of them like **stateful functions**, in the sense that they encapsulate state. 
+
It made things click a bit for me, more than the abstract alphabet soup that other examples used :)

This one gets into some more hands-on examples

* https://www.calhoun.io/5-useful-ways-to-use-closures-in-go/

It also acted as a spoiler for the https://tour.golang.org/moretypes/26[function closure exercise] since that was the first example it gives `:)`

{{< highlight go >}}
func fibonacci() func() int {
	f1 := 1
	f2 := 0
	return func() int {
		f1,f2 = f2, (f1+f2)
		return f1
	}
}
{{< /highlight >}}

I tweaked the version that https://www.calhoun.io/5-useful-ways-to-use-closures-in-go/[I'd seen] so that the return values stated at zero

{{< highlight go >}}
0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 233 377 610 987 1597 2584 4181
