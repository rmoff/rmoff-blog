_Not got time for all this? I've marked ðŸ”¥ for my top reads of the month_ :)

== Data Engineering

* ðŸ”¥ Amongst all the background noise of _ETL vs ELT vs ZeroETL_, https://seattledataguy.substack.com/p/understanding-the-t-in-etl-a-back[this primer from Ben Rogojan] (a.k.a. "The Seattle Data Guy") is a great reminder of the actual 'T' that needs doing to our data, wherever it is that we do it.
* Ask ten engineers in the data space the difference between job titles and you'll get a dozen opinions.
In a sense this doesn't matter, but https://towardsdatascience.com/data-analyst-or-data-engineer-or-analytics-engineer-or-bi-engineer/[this post] is useful for laying out a common understanding of the breakdown of the tasks involved in the different 'buckets'.
* https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/melting-the-ice-how-natural-intelligence-simplified-a-data-lake-migration-to-apache-iceberg/[Details of a migration] from a Hive-based data warehouse to one on Apache Iceberg.
* https://arturastutkus.substack.com/p/we-shut-down-snowflake-and-heres?r=3nzb0&triedRedirect=true[A good look from Kayak at realworld design choices and their implications], including the impact of not using schemas in Kafka, and why they ultimately moved away from Snowflake to Trino instead.
