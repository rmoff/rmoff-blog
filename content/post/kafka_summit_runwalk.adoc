Coming to Kafka Summit in San Francisco next week? Inspired by https://www.facebook.com/oraclesqldev/photos/gm.1401265536847886/1228813493825348/?type=3&theater[similar events] at Oracle OpenWorld in past years, I'm proposing an unofficial run (or walk) across the GoldenGate bridge on the morning of Tuesday 1st October. We should be up and out and back in plenty of time to still attend the morning keynotes. Some people will run, some may prefer to walk, it's open to everyone :)

It's a total of 6km / 3.8 miles. You can see it https://www.strava.com/routes/21896823[on Strava here].

Here's the plan: 

* **Tuesday 1st October @ 06:50** Meet at the GoldenGate bridge (duh), in the https://goo.gl/maps/ABfQ3NBxHzeNWXU88[car park next to the visitor center]. Take a group photo / https://twitter.com/search?q=%23streamingselfie%20%23kafkasummit[#streamingselfie]

Lyft/Uber is probably easiest to get there (c.20 minutes from the Hilton Union Square). 
* 07:00 run/walk across the bridge to https://goo.gl/maps/yixyEvWeznGNoB2x6[the other side] where we'll take another group photo & more https://twitter.com/search?q=%23streamingselfie%20%23kafkasummit[#streamingselfie]
* Run/walk back to the other side, Uber/Lyft back and then on to Kafka Summit day two keynotes which start at 09:00

It's an unofficial runâ€”so up to you to arrange your own transport, etc. Use Twitter (#KafkaSummitBridgeRun) or the #summit channel on the http://cnfl.io/slack[Community slack group] if you want to arrange sharing rides etc.
