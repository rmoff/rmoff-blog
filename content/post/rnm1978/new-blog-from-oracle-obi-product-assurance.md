Blogging from Oracle itself about OBIEE has always been a bit sparse, certainly in comparison to that which there is for core RDBMS.

It’s good to see a new blog emerge in the last couple of months from OBI Product Assurance, including some nice ‘n spicy detailed config/tuning info.

Find it here: <http://blogs.oracle.com/pa/>.

There’s a couple more OBI blogs from Oracle, but both are fairly stale:

- [Implementing Oracle BI & EPM Solutions – Rob Reynolds](http://blogs.oracle.com/robreynolds/)
- [OBIEE Ramblings](http://blogs.oracle.com/bi/)
- [Oracle BI Foundation](http://blogs.oracle.com/bifoundation/) (*thanks Daan for pointing this one out*)
