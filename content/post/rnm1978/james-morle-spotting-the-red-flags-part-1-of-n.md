> *Since it’s been nearly ten years since I wrote my book,* [*Scaling Oracle8i*](http://cseng.aw.com/catalog/academic/product/0,1144,0201325748-TOC,00.html)*, I thought it was about time that I started writing again.

He’s got a really interesting post on “red flags” to look for in diagnosing performance problems in Oracle: [Spotting the Red Flags (Part 1 of n)](http://jamesmorle.wordpress.com/2009/09/24/spotting-the-red-flags-part-1-of-n/).
