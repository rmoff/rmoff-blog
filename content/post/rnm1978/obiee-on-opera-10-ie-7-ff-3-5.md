A new version of the web browser [Opera](http://www.opera.com/) was released recently. Several years ago I used Opera and may even have paid for it IIRC. Then Firefox came along, and the “it’s not IE” excuse was lost for Opera. Not that I mind IE too much nowadays but at the time it was atrocious. Since then I’ve revisited Opera each time a new release has come out, but nothing has impressed me enough to ditch Firefox (and nowadays Google Chrome).

I could start being rude about each browser’s strengths and weaknesses, but I’ll simply leave it at this for now:

WTF has happened to the page on Opera?? I will wager that I’m certainly not the only person who will see Opera do that and hit the uninstall button. I don’t care if it’s standards-compliant and OBIEE is at fault. I don’t care if it solves world poverty. I’m not going to waste my time looking for workarounds when there’s other browsers as capable and work out of the box.

(Firefox mangles the marquee text, but anyone using marquee should be taken out and shot anyway IMO – but fair’s fair, if you want marquee then stick to IE)
