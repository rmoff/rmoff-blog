I read and post a bit on the [OBIEE](http://forums.oracle.com/forums/forum.jspa?forumID=378) and [OBIA](http://forums.oracle.com/forums/forum.jspa?forumID=410&start=0) OTN forums. The noise ratio isn’t too bad, but a few things really get my goat:

<!--more-->
1. Not responding to answers!  
   If I’ve gone out of my way to help, or try to help, at least have the courtesy to acknowledge it, and ideally mark as Helpful or Correct as appropriate.  
   Even a simple “thanks.” would do. It’s just good manners.  
   It also helps people who come along afterwards as you get the completed picture rather than half a question/answer thread.

2. Questions like “how do i install obiee will it work on my amiga”. R.T.F.M. has never been more appropriate!

I’m sure there are more, but that’s my steam vented for the moment 🙂
