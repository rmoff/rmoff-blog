I stumbled across this blog posting recently, and am reposting the link here as I've seen no mention of it elsewhere. This surprised me as with Exadata (and most new technologies) any snippet of news or tech insight gets blogged and tweeted multiple times over.

Any insight into Exadata is interesting as unlike all the other Oracle software which can be downloaded and poked & prodded, this is a physical box so we rely on blog postings and marketing (with a BS filter) to understand more about it.

I'd have liked to see greater explanation of the Querying performance, as there's no non-exadata number to compare with which makes it less useful

Anyway, the article is here: [Oracle Exadata V2 POC results](http://oraclewarehouses.blogspot.com/2010/01/oracle-exadata-v2-poc-results.html)

**Update 24 Feb 2010**: The blog's been taken down, perhaps because these numbers shouldn't have been published. There's still a copy in [Google Cache](http://66.102.9.132/search?hl=en&source=hp&q=cache%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Foraclewarehouses.blogspot.com%2F2010%2F01%2Foracle-exadata-v2-poc-results.html&meta=&aq=f&oq=)
