I'm learning about a lot of the Oracle BI stack through reading manuals and trial-and-error.  
One thing I've realised is that Metalink holds a whole heap of useful information.  
For example, simply searching on "publisher cluster" throws up these two very pertinent docs:  

- OBIEE Clustered Installation with BI Publisher (Doc ID 744515.1)
- BI Publisher does not accept cluster jdbc connection strings (Doc ID 559795.1)

The first one is a [publically available PDF](http://www.oracle.com/technology/products/xml-publisher/docs/BIP_HA.pdf), the second one is the answer to the problem I spent more time than I needed to [scratching my head over yesterday](/2009/03/23/obiee-publisher-configuring-connection-to-clustered-bi-server/).  
  
My attitude until now has been to reach for Metalink after I've become stuck with a problem - I am now going to try searching it as a matter of course when starting out on any new task.  
  
All I need now is an interface that searches both Metalink and Metalink 3. It seems that some docs and bugs are in both, and some only in one or the other :(
