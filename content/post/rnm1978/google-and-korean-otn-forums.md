Why does Google more often than not return the korean (kr) version of OTN forums for a match, but not english?

<!--more-->
If I [search Google for “Send notification:” “oracle.ons.Notification”](http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-GB%3Aofficial&hs=14e&num=30&q=%22Send+notification%3A%22+%22oracle.ons.Notification%22&btnG=Search&meta=) the top hit is for [kr.forums.oracle.com/forums/thread.jspa?threadID=650662](http://kr.forums.oracle.com/forums/thread.jspa?threadID=650662)

If you strip the kr from the URL you get [this](http://forums.oracle.com/forums/thread.jspa?threadID=650662), which makes more sense given the locality when doing the search in Google.

Only mildly irritating, but odd behaviour nonetheless
