I’ve been playing around with [SQL Tuning Sets](http://download.oracle.com/docs/cd/B28359_01/server.111/b28274/sql_tune.htm#i34915), and was trying to clear up my mess.

<!--more-->
To list all the tuning sets:

```

SET WRAP OFF
SET LINE 140
COL NAME FOR A15
COL DESCRIPTION FOR A50 WRAPPED

select name,created,last_modified,statement_count,description 
from DBA_SQLSET
```

```

NAME            CREATED   LAST_MODI STATEMENT_COUNT DESCRIPTION
--------------- --------- --------- --------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
sts_test_02     09-MAR-10 09-MAR-10               1 Test run 1
sts_test_01     12-FEB-10 12-FEB-10               1 an old STS test test test 
```

To delete a tuning set:

```

BEGIN
  DBMS_SQLTUNE.DROP_SQLSET(sqlset_name => 'sts_test_01');
END;
```

But you may hit this message:

> ORA-13757: “SQL Tuning Set” “string” owned by user “string” is active.  
> Cause: The user attempted to update an active SQL Tuning Set.  
> Action: Remove all reference to the SQL Tuning Set and retry the operation.

For example: **ORA-13757: “SQL Tuning Set” “sts\_test\_01” owned by user “badger” is active.**

[Error code reference](http://download.oracle.com/docs/cd/B19306_01/server.102/b14219/e12700.htm)

To look up why the STS is considered active, check the [SQL Tuning Information Views](http://download.oracle.com/docs/cd/B28359_01/server.111/b28274/sql_tune.htm#i35947), in this case DBA\_SQLSET\_REFERENCES

```

SET WRAP OFF
SET LINE 140
COL NAME FOR A15
COL DESCRIPTION FOR A50 WRAPPED

select description, created, owner 
from DBA_SQLSET_REFERENCES 
where sqlset_name = 'sts_test_01';
```

which in my case showed this:

```

DESCRIPTION                                        CREATED   OWNER
-------------------------------------------------- --------- ------------------------------
created by: SQL Tuning Advisor - task: RNM_TT      12-FEB-10 badger
```

So we check for this on DBA\_ADVISOR\_TASKS:

```

SET WRAP OFF
SET LINE 140
COL NAME FOR A15
COL OWNER FOR A10
COL DESCRIPTION FOR A50 WRAPPED

select owner,description, created,last_modified 
from DBA_ADVISOR_TASKS 
where task_name = 'RNM_TT'
```

and it shows this:

```

OWNER      DESCRIPTION                                        CREATED   LAST_MODI
---------- -------------------------------------------------- --------- ---------
badger   SQL Advisor - sts_test_01                           12-FEB-10 12-FEB-10
```

So now we know it’s a stale SQL Tuning Advisor task that uses the SQL Tuning Set, and I definitely want to delete it:

```

BEGIN
  DBMS_SQLTUNE.DROP_TUNING_TASK(task_name => 'RNM_TT');
END;
```

and then I can delete my original SQL Tuning Set:

```

BEGIN
  DBMS_SQLTUNE.DROP_SQLSET(sqlset_name => 'sts_test_01');
END;
```

All done 🙂
