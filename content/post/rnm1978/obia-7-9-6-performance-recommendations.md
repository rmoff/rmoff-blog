A new document has been published by Oracle, discussing ways of improving performance for OBIA 7.9.6 and 7.9.6.1. Its primary focus is around improving ETL performance. There’s some very interesting content including hardware sizing recommendations, and I’d strongly recommend anyone working with OBIA reads it.

It’s called “**Oracle Business Intelligence Applications Version 7.9.6 Performance Recommendations**” and is available on My Oracle Support through [Doc ID 870314.1](https://supporthtml.oracle.com/ep/faces/secure/km/DocumentDisplay.jspx?id=870314.1)
