![](/images/rnm1978/821-0698.gif) A very interesting new PDF from Sun on deploying OBIEE has been published, with discussions on architecture, performance and best practice.

> This Sun BluePrints article describes an enterprise deployment architecture for Oracle Business Intelligence Enterprise Edition using Sun servers running the Solaris Operating System and Sun Storage 7000 Unified Storage systems. Designed to empower employees in organizations in any industry—from customer service, shipping, and finance to manufacturing, human resources, and more—to become potential decision makers, the architecture brings fault tolerance, security, resiliency, and performance to enterprise deployments. Taking advantage of key virtualization technologies, the architecture can be used to consolidate multiple tiers onto a single system to help reduce cost and complexity. A short discussion of the performance characteristics of the architecture using a realistic workload also is included.

The paper's by Maqsood Alam, Luojia Chen, Chaitanya Jadaru, Ron Graham and Giri Mandalika.
