Here's a quotation that I've just read and wanted to share. It is all part of a [BAAG](http://www.battleagainstanyguess.com/) approach to troubleshooting problems, performance in particular.

From Greg Rahn ([web](http://structureddata.org/)|[twitter](http://twitter.com/#!/gregrahn)) on oracle-l:

> There are always exceptions, but exceptions can be justified and supported with data. Just beware of the the silver bullet syndrome...
> 
> The unfortunate part \[...\] is that rarely anyone goes back and does the root cause analysis. It tends to fall into the bucket of "problem...solved".
