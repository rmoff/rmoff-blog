A [brilliant posting here from Jonathan Lewis](http://jonathanlewis.wordpress.com/2009/10/18/experts/) on the subject of Experts. He in turn is quoting Chen Shapira: "DBAs are under a lot of pressure not to be experts.". Read the sentence again, as it took me a minute to figure out. He's writing in the context of an Oracle DBA but I think it's equally applicable to those working with an looking after installations of OBIEE et al.
