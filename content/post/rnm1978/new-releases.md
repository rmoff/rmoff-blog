New releases this week - 10.1.3.4.1 of OBIEE, and 7.9.6 of OBIA.  
  
After a bit of scrabbling around found:  
[](http://download.oracle.com/docs/cd/E10415_01/doc/bi.1013/e10416/general_101341.htm#BABCFCIA)

> ["The 10.1.3.4.1 release of the Oracle Business Intelligence Enterprise Edition introduces no new features."](http://download.oracle.com/docs/cd/E10415_01/doc/bi.1013/e10416/general_101341.htm#BABCFCIA)

  
Though there are some [new bits and pieces for Publisher](http://download.oracle.com/docs/cd/E12844_01/doc/bip.1013/e14667/toc.htm)  
  
For 7.9.6 OBIA, there's no New Features document :(  
By piecing together the "What's New in This Release" for each document you can build up a picture (eg in the [Upgrade Guide](http://download.oracle.com/docs/cd/E14223_01/bia.796/e14218/toc.htm) there's reference to changes for the doc relating to a new version of Informatica), but it would be nice to have it all in one place:  

- Informatica PowerCenter version 8.6 HF 4  
    
- DAC changes?
- Updated BAW schema
- Importantly for our site, support for BAW on Oracle 11g
