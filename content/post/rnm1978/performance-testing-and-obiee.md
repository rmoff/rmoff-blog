Here's my presentation "Performance Testing and OBIEE" that I gave at the [RittmanMead BI Forum 2010](/2010/05/21/rittmanmead-bi-forum-2010/): **[Performance Testing and OBIEE.pptx](https://talks.rmoff.net/performance-testing-and-obiee-sd/)**

It's a Powerpoint 2007 file (pptx) for which you may need the [Microsoft PowerPoint Viewer 2007](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=048dc840-14e1-467d-8dca-19d2a8fd7485&displaylang=en). I've included copious notes on each slide which hopefully cover the gist of what I talked about when I was delivering it. There are also a handful of funky animations which is why I've left it in pptx and not exported to PDF or other format (sorry Open Office users).

I'd love any comments or feedback on the contents of the presentation. Already I have a few things I'd like to build on in it, particularly:

- Per [Emiel's comment](http://twitter.com/bifacts/status/14351591262) around the similarity to Six Sigma, read up on this and expand/incorporate upon in.
- Tony Huljula, who delivered his [BI EE Architectures and Sizing](http://www.peakindicators.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=23:bi-ee-architectures-and-sizing&catid=8:knowledge-base&Itemid=191) presentation, mentioned they'd used the GoURL syntax for performance work, and I'd like to try building on this and incorporate it in a future version of this presentation.
