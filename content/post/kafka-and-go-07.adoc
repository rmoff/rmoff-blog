So far I've been running all my code either in the https://tour.golang.org/[Go Tour sandbox], using https://play.golang.org/[Go Playground], or from a single file in VS Code. My explorations in the link:/2020/07/15/learning-golang-some-rough-notes-s02e06-putting-the-producer-in-a-function-and-handling-errors-in-a-go-routine/[previous article] ended up with a a source file that was starting to get a little bit unwieldily, so let's take a look at how that can be improved. 

Within my link:/2020/07/15/learning-golang-some-rough-notes-s02e06-putting-the-producer-in-a-function-and-handling-errors-in-a-go-routine/[most recent code], I have the `main` function and the `doProduce` function, which is fine when collapsed down:

image::/images/2020/07/func01.png[]

But as soon as it's not starts to get a bit long, so let's split that out into its own file. 

The Go docs have a whole https://twitter.com/rmoff/status/1283723460934619139[section devoted to organising code], but I found it hard to follow. Part of it is probably because I've been living in VSCode and not using the Go environment with modules etc as the docs describe. https://verticalaxisbd.com/blog/code-splitting-go/[This article] helped clarify things a bit for me. Having played around I think I understand it a bit better now, thus: 

* If *all you want to do is split a Go code file into separate ones*, put them all in the same folder with the same package name and use `go run .` to execute them (or continue to run them from within your IDE such as VSCode)
* Files in the same folder with the same package name share access to their functions
* You don't have to do anything with `import` or modules, or anything like that. 
* Leave `package main` alone - you come to change the package name when you're actually building a package for import elsewhere
** At some point you probably *should*, and I'll get onto that another time when I need to :)

So I started with the link:/code/go/kafka/producer_function/producer_function.go[same file as previously], but in a new folder and new name: 

[source,bash]
----
âžœ ls -l listener_test_01 

total 24
-rw-r--r--  1 rmoff  staff  5256 16 Jul 11:17 main.go
----

From there I split `doProduce` into its own source file, giving us: 

[source,bash]
----
âžœ ls -l listener_test_01 
total 32
-rw-r--r--  1 rmoff  staff   741 16 Jul 11:44 main.go
-rw-r--r--  1 rmoff  staff  4595 16 Jul 11:44 producer.go
----

The `main.go` file includes `main()` which then calls other functions

* `main.go`
+
[source,go]
----
package main

import (
        "fmt"
        "os"
)


func main() {

	if e := doProduce(broker, topic); e != nil {
		fmt.Printf("\nThere was a problem calling the producer :-(\n%v", e)
	} else {
		fmt.Println("Oh joy! Oh rejoice! Calling the producer worked *just fine*.")
	}
----

* `producer.go`
+
[source,go]
----
package main

import (
        "errors"
        "fmt"
        "time"

        "gopkg.in/confluentinc/confluent-kafka-go.v1/kafka"
)

// Produce a test message to given broker and topic
func doProduce(broker, topic string) error {

        // --
        // Create Producer instance
----

If you try to just run the `main.go` file you'll get

[source,bash]
----
âžœ go run main.go 
# command-line-arguments
./main.go:26:10: undefined: doProduce
----

So instead you use this (https://stackoverflow.com/a/50593262/350613[h/t]): 

[source,bash]
----
âžœ go run *.go
----

Alternatively you can use

[source,bash]
----
âžœ go run .
----

== Building a binary executable

Instead of compiling and running the code each time with `go run`, you can also build a binary executable which can then be invoking directly. For this simply run: 

[source,bash]
----
go build
----

This builds an executable that takes the name of the parent folder by default

[source,bash]
----
âžœ ls -l listener_test_01 

-rwxr-xr-x  1 rmoff  staff   6.6M 16 Jul 15:30 listener_test_01
-rw-r--r--  1 rmoff  staff   741B 16 Jul 15:01 main.go
-rw-r--r--  1 rmoff  staff   4.5K 16 Jul 15:01 producer.go
----

Now you can run it directly, passing commandline arguments as needed

[source,bash]
----
./listener_test_01 localhost:9092
----

What about `go.mod` that you may have seen kicking about? For my very simple example here all it does is change the name of the executable that we build

[source,bash]
----
âžœ go mod init listenertest
go: creating new go.mod: module listenertest

âžœ go build

âžœ ll
total 27264
-rwxr-xr-x  1 rmoff  staff   6.6M 16 Jul 15:37 listenertest
