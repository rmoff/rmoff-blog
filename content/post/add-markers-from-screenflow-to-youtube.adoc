Screenflow has a useful Markers feature for adding notes to the timeline.

You can use these to helpfully add a table of contents to your Youtube video, but unfortunately Screenflow doesn't have the option to export them directly. Instead, use the free https://bitbucket.org/galad87/subler/wiki/Home[Subler] program as an intermediary (download it from https://bitbucket.org/galad87/subler/downloads/[here]). 

1. Export from Screenflow with a chapters track

2. Open the file in Subler and export to text file

From there, tidy up the text file from the source

{{< highlight shell >}}
CHAPTER03=00:07:17.565
CHAPTER03NAME=Updating documents in Elasticsearch
CHAPTER05=00:11:38.664
CHAPTER05NAME=Deleting documents in Elasticsearch with the sink connector
CHAPTER07=00:16:14.897
CHAPTER07NAME=Schemas and Elasticsearch Document Mappings
CHAPTER08=00:25:57.397
{{< /highlight >}}

into a time / label list for Youtube: 

You can do this manually, or with a bit of RegEx in something like VSCode

[source,bash]

^CHAPTER\d*=(.*)\.\d\d\d$\n.*=(.*)$

{{< highlight shell >}}
$1 $2
{{< /highlight >}}

{{< highlight shell >}}
00:07:17 Updating documents in Elasticsearch
00:11:38 Deleting documents in Elasticsearch with the sink connector
00:16:14 Schemas and Elasticsearch Document Mappings
{{< /highlight >}}

Now paste this list of times into your Youtube video description

When someone views your video they can then click on these times directly
