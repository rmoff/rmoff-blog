Much as I love kcat (ðŸ¤« _it'll always be kafkacat to me_â€¦), this morning I nearly fell out with it ðŸ‘‡ 

ðŸ˜– I thought I was going stir crazy, after listing topics on a broker *and seeing topics from a different broker*.

ðŸ˜µ WTF ðŸ˜µ

<!--more-->

It turns out that the `~/.config.kcat.conf` I created last week and was so proud to thinking to do takes ðŸš¨PRIORITYðŸš¨ over any CLI arguments provided.

So I was merrily telling it with CLI flag -b to use broker X:

[source,bash]
----
kcat -b my-local-broker:9092 -L
----

and it was merrily listing topics from broker Y that's specified in the config file:

[source,bash]
----
$ cat ~/.config/kcat.conf
metadata.broker.list=lol-i-will-use-this-broker-instead-ha-ha-ha:9092
----

NOTE: I still like the config file idea (Kris Jenkins wrote https://blog.jenkster.com/2022/10/setting-up-kcat-config.html[a nice blog article about it here]), I just need to remember about it next time ðŸ¤¦
