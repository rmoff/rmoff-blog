_Not got time for all this? I've marked ðŸ”¥ for my top reads of the month_ :)

<!--more-->

First up, allow me a shameless plug for my blog posts this month:

* https://rmoff.net/2025/07/04/writing-to-apache-iceberg-on-s3-using-kafka-connect-with-glue-catalog/[Writing to **Apache Iceberg on S3 using Kafka Connect** with Glue catalog].
* https://rmoff.net/2025/07/14/keeping-your-data-lakehouse-in-order-table-maintenance-in-apache-iceberg/[Keeping your Data Lakehouse in Order: **Table Maintenance in Apache Iceberg**].
* ðŸ”¥ https://www.confluent.io/blog/streaming-etl-flink-tableflow/[Building Streaming Data Pipelines, Part 2: **Data Processing and Enrichment with Flink SQL**] (see also https://www.confluent.io/blog/building-streaming-data-pipelines-part-1/[Part 1])

And with that, on to this month's set of https://rmoff.net/categories/interesting-links/[Interesting Links].

== Data Engineering

* A nice hands-on example of Sanchit Vijay showing how to use Spark to https://blog.dataengineerthings.org/dare-2-cross-cloud-storage-adventure-s3-r2-d68ed61faece[move data from AWS S3 to Cloudflare R2].
* Interesting details on the Apache DataFusion blog about https://datafusion.apache.org/blog/2025/07/14/user-defined-parquet-indexes/[embedding User-Defined Indexes in Apache Parquet Files].
* ðŸ”¥ My colleague Gilles Philippart wrote up a good guide on getting https://medium.com/@gilles.philippart/build-a-data-lakehouse-with-apache-iceberg-polaris-trino-minio-349c534ecd98[Apache Iceberg, Polaris, Trino, and MinIO] running together locally.
* In _Lakehouse 2.0: The Open System That Lakehouse 1.0 Was Meant to Be_, Animesh Kumar & Travis Thompson discuss the history of the lakehouse and its evolution from closed formats and ecosystems to open formats and interchangable engines https://medium.com/@community_md101/lakehouse-2-0-the-open-system-that-lakehouse-1-0-was-meant-to-be-part-1-743efc645ea6[Part 1] & https://medium.com/@community_md101/introducing-lakehouse-2-0-what-changes-769a1c6a758e[Part 2].
* Data contracts are a good idea, as is standardising themâ€”of which the https://github.com/bitol-io/open-data-contract-standard[Open Data Contract Standard (ODCS)] is an example.
* Jaehyeon Kim looks at https://jaehyeon.me/blog/2025-07-17-self-service-data-platform-via-sql-gateway/[how Apache Kyuubi provides a gateway] between end users and applications, and multiple database engines including Flink, Spark, and Trino.

== Open Table Formats & Catalogs

* Daniel Beach shows how you can use https://dataengineeringcentral.substack.com/p/apache-iceberg-on-databricks[Apache Iceberg on Databricks].
* Amazon S3 now supports https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/compaction-support-for-avro-and-orc-file-formats-in-apache-iceberg-tables-in-amazon-s3/[compaction for Avro and ORC file formats in Apache Iceberg tables].
* ðŸ”¥ Thomas Kejser a.k.a. The Database Doctor gives us his spicy take on **Iceberg, The Right Idea - The Wrong Spec** - https://database-doctor.com/posts/iceberg-is-wrong-1.html[Part 1: History] / https://database-doctor.com/posts/iceberg-is-wrong-2.html[Part 2: The Spec].
Some will argue that at times veracity takes the back seat to telling a rollicking good storyâ€”but it's a fun read regardless of which side of the debate you sit.
* Rahul Joshi explains https://medium.com/capital-one-tech/delta-lake-transaction-logs-explained-6b5f036e64e2[Delta Lake transaction logs].
* Badal Prasad Singh tells us all about https://olake.io/iceberg/iceberg-partitioning-and-writing-strategies[Iceberg Partitioning and Partitioning Writing Strategies].
* Apache Polaris hit the big one-oh release (https://polaris.apache.org/downloads/#100-release[1.00]), and Apache Iceberg got a dot release (https://iceberg.apache.org/releases/#192-release[1.9.2]) with a release candidate (RC) for 1.10 in the works.

== CDC

* ðŸ”¥ Debezium is widely used these days, making VojtÄ›ch JurÃ¡nek's article about https://debezium.io/blog/2025/07/07/quick-perf-check/[improving Debezium performance] a useful reference.
* Abhishek Vishnoi has a hands-on guide that shows https://medium.com/@vishnoiabhishek1/how-to-implement-a-debezium-custom-converter-d203e3b9fb65[how to implement a custom converter in Debezium].

* Debezium https://debezium.io/blog/2025/07/09/debezium-3-2-final-released/[3.2.0.Final Released]

== Kafka and Event Streaming

* _Is it even an edition of Interesting Links if there's not a new Kafka clone, either in a different language or deployed using a different architecture?_
This month, Ravi Atluri writes about https://medium.com/gojekengineering/introducing-xkafka-kafka-but-simpler-for-go-91f4ce3edade[xkafka â€” Kafka, but Simpler (for Go)].
* ðŸ”¥ Mark Teehan has built https://medium.com/@streamsend/a-fancy-way-to-send-a-file-streaming-files-through-kafka-topics-4278fed4bf12[a fancy way to send a file: Streaming Files Through Kafka topics].

== Stream Processing

* AndrÃ© Santos writes about https://www.datanutshell.com/posts/flink_http_full_cache_connector[a new connector for Flink that does HTTP lookups and supports caching].
* There are several interesting papers that have been published recently:
** https://www.vldb.org/pvldb/volumes/18/paper/Streaming%20Time%20Series%20Subsequence%20Anomaly%20Detection%3A%20A%20Glance%20and%20Focus%20Approach[Streaming Time Series Subsequence Anomaly Detection: A Glance and Focus Approach] (_VLDB Volume 18, No. 6_).

** https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.10438[Streaming Democratized: Ease Across the Latency Spectrum with Delayed View Semantics and Snowflake Dynamic Tables] (_SIGMOD/PODS June 2025_).

== RDBMS and General Data Stuff

* Some people read manuals to learn, but if you're like me and like learning through doing the https://www.sqlnoir.com/[SQL Noir] online game is a thriller in which you solve puzzles using SQL skills that you develop.
If this is your kind of thing you'll also like this https://www.sqlnoir.com/blog/games-to-learn-sql[list of SQL games] that SQL Noir also published.
* Are data warehouses a good idea? Definitely. Does everyone need one on day one? Nope. Aleksei Aleinikov has some wise words on https://medium.com/data-engineer-things/five-signs-you-can-skip-the-dwh-in-2025-2078e000faec[when the right time isâ€”and isn'tâ€”to build one].
* ðŸ”¥ Despite the "listicle" titleâ€”_which would normally have me clicking away faster than https://www.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/s/HZz0CsC1ye[Andy Byron can hide from a camera]_â€”this article from Bernd Wessely has some excellent points in it: https://medium.com/data-engineer-things/unlearning-data-architecture-10-myths-worth-killing-946e728f1acf[Unlearning Data Architecture: 10 Myths Worth Killing].
* Ben Dicken explains https://planetscale.com/blog/caching[caching] in this article with nice animations.
* Dominik Tornow has a good https://dtornow.substack.com/p/jepsen-and-tigerbeetle[analysis and commentary] on the findings of the recent https://jepsen.io/analyses/tigerbeetle-0.16.11[Jepsen testing of TigerBeetle].
* Interesting papers:
** https://www.vldb.org/pvldb/volumes/18/paper/Anarchy%20in%20the%20Database%3A%20A%20Survey%20and%20Evaluation%20of%20Database%20Management%20System%20Extensibility[Anarchy in the Database: A Survey and Evaluation of Database Management System Extensibility] (_VLDB Volume 18, No. 6_).
** https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3709675[CRDV: Conflict-free Replicated Data Views] (_Proc. ACM Manag. Data, Vol. 3, No. 1_).

== And finallyâ€¦

_Nothing to do with data, but stuff that I've found interesting or has made me smile._

* Elena Verna writes up https://www.elenaverna.com/p/here-is-how-i-approach-starting-a[her playbook for the first 30, 60, 90 days of a new job].
* ðŸ”¥ Charity Majors is one of my favourite writers, and https://charity.wtf/2025/07/09/thoughts-on-motivation-and-my-40-year-career/[her recent blog post] is a great example.
It's genuine, it's articulate (and it reminds me of _real blogging_ that used to be the norm and is getting swamped these days in AI slop and SEO-chasing bullshit).
* If you're as old as me you'll enjoy this blast of nostalgia courtesy of the Internet Archive's https://blog.archive.org/2025/06/09/keep-on-gifin-a-new-version-of-gifcities-internet-archives-geocities-animated-gif-search-engine/[GeoCities GIF search engine] (_and FTR, it's *always* `/É¡Éªf/`, never `/dÊ’Éªf/` ðŸ˜œ_).
