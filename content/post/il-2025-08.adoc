* 🔥 The https://old.reddit.com/r/apachekafka[`r/apachekafka` subreddit] recently hit 17k members. It's a funny place, with a mix of shills, trolls, n00bs who won't even help themselves—and some lovely community conversations that remind me why I continue to enjoy being part of it :) Here are a handful of threads that caught my eye if you want to sample the fare:

== Open Table Formats & Catalogs

_Let's be honest, it's mostly just Apache Iceberg…_😅

* 🔥 I spent some time looking into Flink vs Kafka Connect vs Tableflow for getting data into Iceberg, and wrote up some of the comparison points: https://rmoff.net/2025/08/18/kafka-to-iceberg-exploring-the-options/[Kafka to Iceberg - Exploring the Options]
* Aiven published https://github.com/Aiven-Open/tiered-storage-for-apache-kafka/blob/main/iceberg_whitepaper.md[a whitepaper] with details of their plans for writing to Iceberg directly from Kafka
* David Reger published a https://blog.msgdataplatform.com/from-kafka-topics-to-iceberg-with-confluent-tableflow-5708e02d0d0a[detailed writeup] of Tableflow (Confluent's tool for getting data from Kafka to Iceberg).
* A while back https://lakefs.io/blog/data-engineering-patterns-write-audit-publish/[I wrote about] the Write-Audit-Publish pattern, and so enjoyed reading these two blog posts from Turóczy Attila about https://freedium.cfd/https://medium.com/@aturoczy/elegant-etl-with-apache-iceberg-branching-489a3bb89a41[branching] and https://freedium.cfd/https://medium.com/@aturoczy/tagging-in-apache-iceberg-fdb7a19c0bf2[tagging] in Apache Iceberg.
* 🔥 Details of taking practical advantage of more Iceberg features including time travel and schema evolution are covered in this article about building https://www.infoq.com/articles/reproducible-ml-iceberg/[reproducible ML systems with Iceberg and SparkSQL]
* A nice hands-on example of https://freedium.cfd/https://medium.com/@aalopatin/from-kafka-to-iceberg-sinking-kafka-topics-into-iceberg-tables-e23edec2777b[using the Kafka Connect Iceberg sink] with Nessie and MinIO.
* The columnar format https://github.com/vortex-data/vortex[Vortex] has been https://www.linuxfoundation.org/press/lf-ai-data-foundation-hosts-vortex-project-to-power-high-performance-data-access-for-ai-and-analytics[donated] to the Linux Foundation. Earlier this year there was a https://spiraldb.com/post/vortex-on-ice[PoC to show how it can speed up Iceberg queries], with an https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6ZKY8JViCA[interesting talk] at Iceberg Summit on the same.
* A https://www.alibabacloud.com/blog/apache-paimon-real-time-lake-storage-with-iceberg-compatibility-2025_602485[comprehensive introduction] summarised from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEdz53_diW4&list=PLDX4T_cnKjD2qa7EwyxHb9H8pBACbGkkE&index=4[a talk] at this year's Flink Forward Asia conference about "the other" open table format that people often forget—Apache Paimon. TIL it supports integration with Iceberg.

== Stream Processing
* https://flink.apache.org/2025/07/31/apache-flink-2.1.0-ushers-in-a-new-era-of-unified-real-time-data--ai-with-comprehensive-upgrades/[Apache Flink 2.1.0] has been released
* Ming Hung Tsai wrote a https://itnext.io/scaling-to-1-million-ticket-reservations-part-1-dataflow-architecture-c6d0c792244a[three] https://itnext.io/scaling-to-1-million-ticket-reservations-part-2-data-driven-optimizations-228c6a52e00a[part] https://itnext.io/scaling-to-1-million-ticket-reservations-part-3-infra-observability-load-test-6bb55b850c72[series] showing how you could use Kafka Streams to implement a ticket reservation system (_also discussed in the Reddit thread linked above_)
* 🔥 Sometimes the old ones are the best—and this article from Tyler Akidau nine years ago is still just as important to read today if you're thinking about stream processing: https://www.oreilly.com/radar/the-world-beyond-batch-streaming-102/[Streaming 102: The world beyond batch—The what, where, when, and how of unbounded data processing].
* LinkedIn's Jiangjie Qin, a PMC member for both Apache Flink and Apache Kafka, spoke at QCon SF about https://www.infoq.com/presentations/stream-finch/[Stream and Batch Processing Convergence in Flink]
* Should you use a hammer to tighten a screw? Should you try and express _all_ your stream processing needs in SQL? https://nussknacker.io/blog/why-streaming-sql-is-not-the-right-tool-for-authoring-event-driven-stream-based-algorithms/[also no].
* https://lists.apache.org/thread/x02d8klqxqst3nwzmg2g4vh17zpg53sz[FLIP-541] is a proposal to make PyFlink more Pythonic, and looks to have wide support in the community.
* Databricks https://www.databricks.com/blog/introducing-real-time-mode-apache-sparktm-structured-streaming[announced] the public preview of a real-time mode for Spark Structured Streaming. It will be donated to the Apache Spark project but is currently only available on Databricks.

== RDBMS + CDC
* Debezium https://debezium.io/blog/2025/08/13/debezium-3-2-1-final-released/[3.2.1.Final] and https://debezium.io/blog/2025/08/05/debezium-3-3-alpha1-released/[3.3.0.Alpha1] have been released
* Yingjun Wu has written a https://freedium.cfd/https://medium.com/@yingjunwu/why-we-didnt-rewrite-debezium-in-rust-66c35ae9dce8[good explanation] about why RisingWave use the embedded https://debezium.io/documentation//reference/stable/development/engine.html[Debezium Engine] in their product—and why they didn't rewrite it in Rust to match the rest of their product code.
* A practical guide from Nick Tobey on https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-06-25-polymorphic-associations/[choosing a database schema for polymorphic data].
* 🔥 Richard van der Hoff writes about something to strike fear into any DBA's heart: corruption in the database. In this case, a https://matrix.org/blog/2025/07/postgres-corruption-postmortem/[corrupted Postgres index].
* More Postgres goodness, this time from Gunnar Morling: https://www.morling.dev/blog/postgres-replication-slots-confirmed-flush-lsn-vs-restart-lsn/[Postgres Replication Slots: Confirmed Flush LSN vs. Restart LSN]

== General Data Stuff
* 🔥🔥 Hot off the press is another banger from Jack Vanlightly, this time looking at https://jack-vanlightly.com/blog/2025/8/21/a-conceptual-model-for-storage-unification[A Conceptual Model for Storage Unification]. If you're interested in things like writing Kafka data to Iceberg, this is a vital foundation for understanding the design considerations and trade-offs.
* How Klaviyo use Ray for their https://freedium.cfd/https://klaviyo.tech/ray-data-train-tune-at-klaviyo-bca9f14abf21[scalable data processing, training, and optimization]
* Prompted by https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5t3b3EAc84&t=360s[a talk that Tesla gave] about ingesting metrics into ClickHouse, Javier Santana at TinyBird https://www.tinybird.co/blog-posts/1b-rows-per-second-clickhouse[set out to reproduce the feat using a 50-node ClickHouse cluster]. In a sense these exercises are somewhat BSD and clickbait-y, but I do like the clear steps and detail that he showed in the blog post :).
* 🔥 If anyone is going to need to build their own time-series database (TSDB), Datadog is going to be one of the top contenders. In https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/engineering/rust-timeseries-engine/[this blog post] they write about how they built it using Rust and the benefits they saw (60x ingest, 5x query). Also interesting is https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/engineering/rust-timeseries-engine/#how-we-built-the-6th-generation-of-our-real-time-metrics-storage[the history] of their previous TSDB platforms.
* https://github.com/cwida/FastLanes[FastLanes] describes itself as a _Next-Gen Big Data File Format_, aimed as a replacement to columnar formats such as the somewhat-ubiquitous Parquet. Beyond several https://github.com/cwida/FastLanes?tab=readme-ov-file#publications[conference papers] it's unclear if there's any adoption of the format in the wild yet.


== And finally…

_Nothing to do with data, but stuff that I've found interesting or has made me smile._

* 🔥 Brad Stulberg's article https://freedium.cfd/https://bstulberg.medium.com/motivation-is-overrated-heres-what-works-instead-7c5744efd82f[Motivation is Overrated: Here's What Works Instead] is down to earth and well worth a read.

> I’d devour blog posts about getting things done or spot a cool app and think “this is it, this will finally organize me.” I’d burn hours building the perfect system, creating categories, tags, projects, labels. Setting it up felt like work.

* A healthy dose of nostalgia from https://blog.decryption.net.au/posts/macpaint.html[MacPaint Art From The Mid-80s Still Looks Great Today] (_although cards on the table, I was on the BBC Micro/Acorn Archimedes side of things_ 😅)
* It may seem odd to compile a list of "Why I want to leave" the day that you start a new job, but https://blog.incrementalforgetting.tech/p/the-why-i-want-to-leave-list[this article makes a compelling case] for starting, and maintaining, such a list.
