**Another year, another Current—another 5k run/walk for anyone who'd like to join!**

<!--more-->

This is a tradition that started back at Kafka Summit San Francisco in 2019 https://twitter.com/rmoff/status/1179047181891883008[over the Golden Gate Bridge] and has continued since then.

TIP: London's Docklands offer up what would charitably be described as not the most…picturesque of routes—but with a group of similar minded people, what could be a better way to start day 1 of Current 2025 London than a 5k run or walk :) Plus, it's flat! 🙌


== Who? What? Where? When?

* _Who_:  Anyone who would like to is very welcome :)
* _What_: A 5k (3.1 miles) run or walk
* _Where_: Starting from the Aloft Hotel (next to the ExCeL centre), heading clockwise around the quayside at ExCeL, and taking in some of the Parkrun route.
* _When_: **Tuesday 20th May at 07:00 BST**.

We'll **meet at 07:00** in the carpark in front of the hotel. That'll give us time to congregate and take some https://twitter.com/search?q=%23streamingselfie%20%23kafkasummit%20until%3A2020-03-01&src=typed_query&f=live[`#streamingselfie`]s if you want them, before setting off at 07:05 sharp to make our way around the https://www.strava.com/clubs/1039355/group_events/2028172[the 5k route].

Go at your own pace; this isn't a race. You can run, or walk. Or skip, if you prefer. You can link:/files/current-london-2025-5k.gpx[download the route] to follow at your leisure. In fact, it's a good idea to do so because this is not an organised event, so it's your responsibility not to get lost :-D

If you Strava, feel free to join the https://www.strava.com/clubs/1039355[Strava Club].

== Cool, where do I register?

Register at `/dev/null` ;-)

This is an entirely unofficial, barely-organised, thing. Turn up and run, if you want. Don't, if you don't. Fully intend to but sleep in from the jetlag and miss it, that's completely fine 😁
