I've used https://www.alfredapp.com/[Alfred] for years, and it's one of the first apps I'll install on a fresh Mac. It's like the Cmd-Space search integration that MacOS has, but *so much more than that*. Here's a few of the really powerful features that makes it the first app I'll reach for to install on any new Mac - and which it'll feel like I'm trying to work with one arm tied behind my back if I don't have :)

* *Clipboard history*. Every time you âŒ˜-C what you copy goes onto the clipboard history, which you can search. So you can then paste not only the thing you just copied, but anything else you copied previously! It is *SO* powerful.

It works with *images* too!

* *File search*. Not just file search, but *FILE SEARCH*! You can preview files, and even drag and drop them directly into an application

*  *Snippets*. Kinda like the clipboard history, and integrated with it too, you can predefine static or dynamic (e.g. date) text to paste into a target. Pretty handy when you don't want to memorise the exact name of each Kafka Connect converter class ;)

*  *Spell* and *Define*. These are invaluably and so super-easy to use.

** Define:

*  *Workflows*. I've only scratched the surface of these, but I can do neat stuff like pair a particular bluetooth headset and then play a noise to confirm that it's worked. 
+

*  *Calculator*. Just like spell and define, this is another useful little tool there at your fingertips. Nothing fancy, just very easy to access and use
