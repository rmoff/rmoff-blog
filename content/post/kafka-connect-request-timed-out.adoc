A short & sweet blog post to help people Googling for this error, and me next time I encounter it. 

The scenario: trying to create a connector in Kafka Connect (running in distributed mode, one worker) failed with the `curl` response

{{< highlight shell >}}

But, no error in the Kafka Connect worker log (at `INFO` level anyway). Most puzzling. After a lot of back & forth comparing my config with a working environment I tracked this down to a mis-configuration of my Kafka broker. Running a single broker, I had not specified an override value for the configuration `offsets.topic.replication.factor`, which meant that it took the default of three. Three replicas, but only one broker…that's not going to be a good situation, and well it wasn't on checking my broker log which was full of continually repeating errors:

This error can be ignored if the cluster is starting up and not all brokers are up yet. (kafka.server.KafkaApis)

Presumably since Kafka Connect uses the offsets topic for its https://rmoff.net/2019/11/22/common-mistakes-made-when-configuring-multiple-kafka-connect-workers/[own internal load balancing] the absence of it caused Kafka Connect to not be able to create a connector. 

The solution? Configure Kafka correctly :) Since I was using Docker Compose for my cluster I set:

KAFKA_OFFSETS_TOPIC_REPLICATION_FACTOR: 1

After bouncing the Kafka broker, Kafka Connect worked fine.
