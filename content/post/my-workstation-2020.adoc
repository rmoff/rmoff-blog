_Is a blog even a blog nowadays if it doesn't include a "Here is my home office setup"?_

Thanks to conferences all being online, and thus my talks being delivered from my study—and https://twitter.com/search?q=speakerselfie%20(from%3Armoff)&src=typed_query&f=live[my habit of posting a #SpeakerSelfie] each time I do a conference talk—I often get questions about my setup. Plus, I'm kinda pleased with it so I want to show it off too ;-)
