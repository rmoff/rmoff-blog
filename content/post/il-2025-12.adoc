Well it's that time of year already!
Whilst munching on a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mince_pie[mince pie], enjoy the final Interesting Links for 2025.

_It's been a busy twelve months for me; this time last year I was signing off from my last company, which went on to be https://redis.io/blog/redis-to-acquire-decodable-to-turbocharge-our-real-time-data-platform/[acquired]—and last week I found out that my current company (Confluent) is to be https://newsroom.ibm.com/2025-12-08-ibm-to-acquire-confluent-to-create-smart-data-platform-for-enterprise-generative-ai[acquired by IBM]._
_Despite my reaction against any kind of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Who_Moved_My_Cheese%3F[cheese moving], I figure this is going to be an interesting development and a whole new experience for me :)_

Just one blog post of my own to share from this month—a write-up of some investigation that I did using Neo4j and graph analysis to identify link:/2025/12/01/using-graph-analysis-with-neo4j-to-spot-astroturfing-on-reddit/[astroturfing on Reddit].
It turns out that there are marketing agencies out there who think it's a good idea to spoil things for everyone else by offering astroturfing-as-a-service to at least two vendors in this space who paid them for it 🙄.

My previous employer has kindly allowed me to host my previous blog posts here on rmoff.net, which I'm delighted about.
If you've not seen them already, here are some of the highlights:

* link:/2024/10/15/why-do-i-need-cdc/[Why Do I Need CDC?] & link:/2024/12/11/exploring-flink-cdc/[Exploring Flink CDC]
* link:/2024/07/18/sending-data-to-apache-iceberg-from-apache-kafka-with-apache-flink/[Sending Data to Apache Iceberg from Apache Kafka with Apache Flink]
* Troubleshooting Flink SQL link:/2024/08/06/troubleshooting-flink-sql-s3-problems/[S3] & link:/2024/02/27/flink-sql-and-the-joy-of-jars/[general JAR problems]
* Catalogs in Flink SQL: link:/2024/02/16/catalogs-in-flink-sqla-primer/[A Primer] & link:/2024/02/19/catalogs-in-flink-sqlhands-on/[Hands On]

And so…on with the interesting links!

_Not got time for all this? I've marked 🔥 for my top reads of the month_ :)

TIP: Medium posts often skulk behind a gate, so I've hyperlinked to the Freedium version and included a link to the original using a ⓜ️ icon should you prefer to visit that (or if freedium goes offline).

* What's old is new, and nowhere is that more true at the moment than with the semantic layer—a concept that has been around in IT for _decades_. My former boss Mark Rittman has a great write-up here of one of the tools that was there then: https://blog.rittmananalytics.com/an-homage-to-oracle-warehouse-builder-25-years-ahead-of-its-time-22b9b9c4363c[An Homage to Oracle Warehouse Builder].
* Ojesav Srivastava at Flipkart writes up Triton, a ZooKeeper-coordinated Coordinator/Master/Worker platform on Kubernetes StatefulSets for reliable, high‑throughput https://blog.flipkart.tech/triton-scaling-bulk-operations-with-a-feed-processing-platform-94c750efa07c[bulk file ingest at scale].

== Open Table Formats (OTF), Catalogs, Lakehouses etc.
* WarpStream's Richard Artoul has written an explainer of how their https://www.warpstream.com/blog/what-react-and-apache-iceberg-have-in-common-scaling-iceberg-with-virtual-metadata[Tableflow product efficiently writes Iceberg metadata].

* Just as the advent of OTFs blew up our assumptions about how to store data for tabular access, flat file formats such as Parquet are now in the spotlight. Moshe Derri https://medium.com/@moshederri/replacements-for-parquet-anyone-c66c28cf300e[looks at one of the possible replacements, Vortex].
* 🔥 The PMC chair for Apache Parquet, Julien Le Dem, has https://sympathetic.ink/2025/12/11/Column-Storage-for-the-AI-era.html[written an article] looking at the criticisms of Parquet, and suggests various evolutions of the project to address these which would have the additional benefit of retaining the wide interoperability that is so important.
* 🔥 Staying with the file format theme, https://lancedb.com/blog/from-bi-to-ai-lance-and-iceberg/[this post] from Jack Ye and Prashanth Rao at LanceDB is interesting as it positions Lance as not just a file format, but _also_ a table format—a qualification that I'd not come across before.

== RDBMS

* 🔥 Very cool deep-dive by Radim Marek into https://boringsql.com/posts/vacuum-is-lie/[Postgres indexes and storage].
* https://www.uber.com/en-GB/blog/improving-mysql-cluster-uptime-part1/[Two] https://www.uber.com/en-GB/blog/improving-mysql-cluster-uptime-part2/[part] series from Siddharth Singh and team at Uber looking at how they manage high-availability for their MySQL clusters.
* Sometimes the answer is not NoSQL, but No! SQL. Or something like that. Anyway, Trendyol have written about https://medium.com/trendyol-tech/seller-eligibility-system-our-journey-from-nosql-to-rdbms-f56dafaa1f02[their challenges with Couchbase (NoSQL) and subsequent migration to Postgres].

== General Data Stuff
* 🔥 Industry luminaries Mike Stonebraker and Andy Pavlo present their https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnQKluxWB5Y[2025 Year in Review]
* Ergest Xheblati https://sqlpatterns.com/p/the-most-powerful-timeless-skill[argues that the most important skill as a data professional] isn't fancy SQL or l33t coding; it's being able to work within an organisation to identify where you can have the most benefit and help identify the actual questions the business want to answer from the data.
* A new paper from Matthias Jasny and others looking at https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.04859v1[io_uring for High-Performance DBMSs: When and How to Use It]
* 🪦 RIP MinIO :( Previously an excellent choice for building demos and PoCs for projects that needed S3 storage locally, MinIO has spent the last few months dismantling their community offering, https://github.com/minio/object-browser/pull/3509[removing the GUI], https://github.com/minio/minio/issues/21647#issuecomment-3418675115[ending Docker builds], and now moving the https://github.com/minio/minio/commit/27742d469462e1561c776f88ca7a1f26816d69e2[project into maintenance mode].
* Arkadiusz Chmura looks at idempotency and effectively-once processing in his blog post https://blog.allegro.tech/2025/12/transactions-arent-enough.html[Transactions Aren’t Enough: The Need For End-To-End Thinking]

== AI
_I warned you link:/2025/09/30/interesting-links-september-2025/#_ai[previously]…this AI stuff is here to stay, and it'd be short-sighted to think otherwise._
_As I read and learn more about it, I'm going to share interesting links (the clue is in the blog post title) that I find—whilst trying to avoid the breathless hype and slop._

[NOTE]
====
A request to you: Are there any good blog posts out there documenting how companies are _actually_ implementing their user-facing AI features?

For example, Strava has the awfully-named "Athlete Intelligence" (AI - geddit?!) - but I would love to see how it's built.

It feels like there's a chasm between "ooooh you can build this" from the vendors (hi!) and the reality of actually building with it. Perhaps that's always the case, but for hype stuff it's even more valuable to hear [unfiltered] stories of how people _really_ build with it.
