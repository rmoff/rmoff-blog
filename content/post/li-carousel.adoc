TIP: tl;dr: Upload a PDF document in which each slide of the carousel is one page.

I wanted to post a Carousel post in LinkedIn, but had to wade through a million pages of crap in Google from companies trying to sell shit.
Here's how to do it simply.

<!--more-->

1. Create your carousel slides.
I like using Excalidraw.
Here's an example of two simple slides (that I'll use for posting this article on LinkedIn ∞)
+
image:/images/2025/03/1.png[]

2. Export each slide as its own image file.
In Excalidraw select the objects that you want to make up the slide and hit shift-cmd-E.
Set it to `Only selected`, and save the PNG into a folder.

3. You should now have a folder of one or more images:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ tree my_carousel_slides
my_carousel_slides
├── 1.png
└── 2.png
----

4. Install imagemagick:
+
[source,bash]
----
brew install imagemagick
----

5. Convert your image files to a single PDF:
+
[source,bash]
----
magick my_carousel_slides/*.png linkedin_carousel.pdf
----

6. Create a LinkedIn post, click on add a **Document**, upload your PDF, give it a title
+
image:/images/2025/03/3.png[]
+
image:/images/2025/03/4.png[]

7. Erm. That's it.
