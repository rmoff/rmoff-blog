https://www.alfredapp.com/[Alfred] is one of my favourite productivity apps for the Mac. It's a file indexer, a clipboard manager, a snippet expander - and that's just scratching the surface really. I recently got a new machine without it installed and realised _just how much_ I rely on Alfred, particularly its clipboard manager. 

<!--more-->

With the clipboard manager Alfred keeps a history of the text (and images, cool huh!) that I put on my clipboard, and I can recall any of them using a simple shortcut

The clipboard itself is stored in a file by Alfred, and is just a SQLite database. Since it's that, you can query it using SQL!

To find your clipboard history file go to Alfred's preferences pane and Advanced. Click the `Reveal in Finder` in the bottom right of the window, and in the resulting folder there should be a `Databases` sub-folder and within that a `clipboard.alfdb` file. 

NOTE: This is not intended as a user-servicable file! Don't blame me if opening it in SQLite knackers it, and definitely don't try running `UPDATE`s against it…

With the file located, you can query it by opening it up with SQLite: 

{{< highlight shell >}}
$ sqlite3 clipboard.alfdb
{{< /highlight >}}

Here's the clipboard history table's schema: 

{{< highlight sql >}}
.schema clipboard

CREATE TABLE clipboard(item, ts decimal, app, apppath, dataType integer, dataHash);
CREATE INDEX clipboard_items ON clipboard (item);
CREATE INDEX clipboard_ts ON clipboard (ts);
CREATE INDEX clipboard_app ON clipboard (app);
CREATE INDEX clipboard_datatype ON clipboard (dataType);
CREATE INDEX clipboard_datahash ON clipboard (dataHash);
{{< /highlight >}}

You can query individual rows: 

{{< highlight sql >}}
sqlite> .header on
sqlite> .mode column
sqlite> SELECT * FROM clipboard LIMIT 1;

item                                                                                 ts          app            apppath                          dataType    dataHash

and you can run aggregations on it, here showing which application I most frequently copy content from: 

{{< highlight sql >}}
sqlite> select app,count(*) from clipboard group by app order by 2 desc;
app            count(*)

or even how many times I've copied a link from my blog to send to someone :-)

{{< highlight sql >}}
sqlite> SELECT count(*) FROM clipboard WHERE item LIKE '%rmoff.net%';
