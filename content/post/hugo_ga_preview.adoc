This blog is written in Asciidoc, built using Hugo, and hosted on GitHub Pages. I recently wanted to share the draft of a post I was writing with someone and ended up exporting a local preview to a PDF - not a great workflow! This blog post shows you how to create an automagic hosted preview of any draft content on Hugo using GitHub Actions.

This is useful for previewing and sharing one's own content, but also for making good use of GitHub as a collaborative platform - if someone https://github.com/rmoff/rmoff-blog/pull/4#pullrequestreview-933907051[reviews and amends your PR] the post gets updated in the preview too.

I link:/2020/12/20/scheduling-hugo-builds-on-github-pages-with-github-actions/[wrote previously] about using GitHub Actions to automagically build and deploy my blog whenever I push new content to the GitHub repo that hosts the source. My friend https://twitter.com/gunnarmorling[Gunnar Morling] does not only do that with https://www.morling.dev/[his blog], but he also has a neat preview functionality for new content in a Pull Request (PR). I'm writing this blog to document the steps I took to mimic https://github.com/gunnarmorling/morling.dev/blob/master/.github/workflows/preview.yml[his setup] :) 

In essence it's the same as link:/2020/12/20/scheduling-hugo-builds-on-github-pages-with-github-actions/[deploying the production Hugo site to GitHub Pages], except it's hosted on https://surge.sh/[`https://surge.sh/`] instead and with a variable URL (since you might have multiple drafts each with their own PR). 

== Setting up an account on surge.sh

https://surge.sh/[`https://surge.sh/`] is not a shell script as the name may suggest, but a hosted service that provides `Static web publishing for Front-End Developers`. Their audience is denoted very clearly by the fact you can't sign up online - they assume that _of course_ you'll have `npm` installed (because you're a front-end developer, right). For us heathens without it, you need to install `npm` first which you can do via `brew` (which in turn you can install using `npm`â€¦only kidding)

[source,bash]
----
brew install npm
----

Then install surge

[source,bash]
----
npm install --global surge
----

With it installed you can then create an account

[source,bash]
----
$ surge login

   Login (or create surge account) by entering email & password.

          email: robin+surge@moffatt.me
       password:

   Success - Logged in as robin+surge@moffatt.me.
----

Check your email and verify your email address, and then go and create an authentication token: 

[source,bash]
----
$ surge token

== Building the Workflow

This is all built around creating a https://docs.github.com/en/actions[GitHub Actions] https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions[workflow]. It will do the following: 

1. Trigger when a new PR is created
2. Checkout the code from the PR source branch
3. Install the dependencies on the container that's running
4. Set a variable to hold the target URL for the deployed preview
5. Build the Hugo site
6. Deploy the built preview to https://surge.sh/[`https://surge.sh/`]

Let's look at each of these in detail. Each section contributes a lump of YAML which builds the overall workflow. 

=== Triggering a GitHub Action on a PR

There are many events in a GitHub repository that can trigger an action, including a https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#pull_request[`pull_request`]. You can refine it further using a https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#using-filters[filter], such as only a pull request that's been marked as ready for review. Here I'm just going to target PRs that are [re-]opened, which is the default and so https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#pull_request[per the docs] no filter is needed:

[source,yaml]
----
on:
  pull_request:
----

=== Checkout the code

https://github.com/actions/checkout[This action] checks out the code from the PR branch. It can be configured to fetch other branches if required, but per the doc: 

> Only a single commit is fetched by default, for *the ref/SHA that triggered the workflow*

[source,yaml]
----
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
----

=== Install dependencies

This is the same as used for the live site (which kinda makes sense, given that this is to be a preview of it)

[source,yaml]
----
    - name: Install Ruby Dev                     
      run: sudo apt-get install ruby-dev

    - name: Install AsciiDoctor and Rouge
      run: sudo gem install asciidoctor rouge

    - name: Setup Hugo                           
      uses: peaceiris/actions-hugo@v2
      with:
        hugo-version: '0.85.0'
----

=== Determining the preview URL

To deploy to `surge.sh` I used the same GitHub Action as Gunnar, which is https://github.com/afc163/surge-preview[this one]. The URL that it deploys to is determined by the source repository and PR number: 

> `https://{{repository.owner}}-{{repository.name}}-{{job.name}}-pr-{{pr.number}}.surge.sh`

These break down as follows: 

* `repository.owner`: `rmoff`
* `repository.name`: `rmoff-blog`
* `job.name`: This is the name of the job, specified under `jobs:` in the YAML that defines the Workflow. 
* `pr.number`: The PR number, which can be obtained from a variable in the workflow. 

I'm stealing https://github.com/gunnarmorling/morling.dev/blob/master/.github/workflows/preview.yml#L17[Gunnar's nice bit of code] here to determine the PR number :) 

[source,yaml]
----
    - name: Setup base URL env var
      run: |
        export PRNUMBER=$(jq --raw-output .pull_request.number "$GITHUB_EVENT_PATH") 
        echo BASEURL="https://rmoff-rmoff-blog-preview-pr-"$PRNUMBER".surge.sh/" >> $GITHUB_ENV
----

Note that `export` works locally to a step, but to pass the variable between steps you append the setting of it to `$GITHUB_ENV`

=== Build the Hugo site

Instead of simply calling `hugo` which builds the site, we add a few command line flags to build draft posts (`--buildDrafts`), future-dated posts (`--buildFuture`), and also change the base URL (`--baseURL`) which by default (per the https://github.com/rmoff/rmoff-blog/blob/master/config.yaml[`config.yaml`]) is the live site (`rmoff.net`). 

Note that if the base URL is incorrectly set the resulting built site won't render properly - you'll get missing CSS files, weird relative links, etc. 

=== Deploying the built site to surge.sh

https://github.com/afc163/surge-preview[This action] deploys the built site (under `/public`, specified in the `dist` parameter) from the previous step to surge.sh: 

[source,yaml]
----
    - name: Preview
      uses: afc163/surge-preview@v1
      id: preview_step
      with:
        surge_token: ${{ secrets.SURGE_TOKEN }}
        github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        dist: public
        failOnError: 'true'
        teardown: true
        build: |
          echo Deploying to surge.sh
----

== The finished workflow

[source,yaml]
----
include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rmoff/rmoff-blog/master/.github/workflows/preview-blog.yaml[]
----

Put this YAML in a file in your github repository root folder under `.github/workflows/`. 

== The workflow in action

1. Create a branch of the main branch, into which you will commit a new blog post:
+
[source,bash]
----
git checkout -b my_new_article
----

2. Start writing your blog. Once it's ready to publish as a draft, commit it and push to GitHub: 
+
[source,bash]
----
git add content/post/never_gonna_give_you_up.adoc
git commit -m "Draft ready for review"
git push --set-upstream origin my_new_article
----

3. Create a PR from the new branch:
+
image::/images/2022/04/pr1.png[]
+
image::/images/2022/04/pr2.png[]
+
When you create the PR you'll notice that a check has been added to it - this is the action that's configured by the workflow and triggered by the PR being created
+
image::/images/2022/04/pr2a.png[]

4. As the action runs you'll see it update the PR with its status, and then a completion message including the URL to which the preview has been uploaded
+
image::/images/2022/04/pr4.png[]

5. Bask in the glory of a nice preview of your new article, whilst safely not impinging upon your live site.
