This blog is written in Asciidoc, built using Hugo, and hosted on GitHub Pages. I recently wanted to share the draft of a post I was writing with someone and ended up exporting a local preview to a PDF - not a great workflow! This blog post shows you how to create an automagic hosted preview of any draft content on Hugo using GitHub Actions.

<!--more-->

I link:/2020/12/20/scheduling-hugo-builds-on-github-pages-with-github-actions/[wrote previously] about using GitHub Actions to automagically build and deploy my blog whenever I push new content to the GitHub repo that hosts the source. My friend https://twitter.com/gunnarmorling[Gunnar Morling] does not only that with https://www.morling.dev/[his blog], but also a neat preview functionality for new content in a Pull Request (PR). I'm writing this blog to document the steps I took to mimic https://github.com/gunnarmorling/morling.dev/blob/master/.github/workflows/preview.yml[his setup] :) 

In essence it's the same as link:/2020/12/20/scheduling-hugo-builds-on-github-pages-with-github-actions/[deploying the production Hugo site to GitHub Pages], except it's hosted on https://surge.sh/[`https://surge.sh/`] instead and with a variable URL (since you might have multiple drafts each with their own PR). 

== Setting up an account on surge.sh

https://surge.sh/[`https://surge.sh/`] is not a shell script as the name may suggest, but a hosted service that provides `Static web publishing for Front-End Developers`. Their audience is denoted very clearly by the fact you can't sign up online - they assume that _of course_ you'll have `npm` installed (because you're a front-end developer, right). For us heathens without it, you need to install `npm` first which you can do via `brew` (which in turn you can install using `npm`…only kidding)

[source,bash]
----
brew install npm
----

Then install surge

[source,bash]
----
npm install --global surge
----

With it installed you can then create an account

[source,bash]
----
$ surge login

   Login (or create surge account) by entering email & password.

          email: robin+surge@moffatt.me
       password:

   Success - Logged in as robin+surge@moffatt.me.
----

Check your email and verify your email address, and then go and create an authentication token: 

[source,bash]
----
$ surge token

== Building the Workflow

This is all built around creating a https://docs.github.com/en/actions[GitHub Actions] https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions[workflow]. It will do the following: 

1. Trigger when a new PR is created
2. Checkout the code from the PR source branch
3. Install the dependencies on the container that's running
4. Set a variable to hold the target URL for the deployed preview
5. Build the Hugo site
6. Deploy the built preview to https://surge.sh/[`https://surge.sh/`]

Let's look at each of these in detail. Each section contributes a lump of YAML which builds the overall workflow. 

=== Triggering a GitHub Action on a PR

There are many events in a GitHub repository that can trigger an action, including a https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#pull_request[`pull_request`]. You can refine it further using a https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#using-filters[filter], such as only a pull request that's been marked as ready for review. Here I'm just going to target PRs that are [re-]opened, which is the default and so https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#pull_request[per the docs] no filter is needed:

[source,yaml]
----
on:
  pull_request:
----

=== Checkout the code

https://github.com/actions/checkout[This action] checks out the code from the PR branch. It can be configured to fetch other branches if required, but per the doc: 

> Only a single commit is fetched by default, for *the ref/SHA that triggered the workflow*

[source,yaml]
----
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
----

=== Install dependencies

This is the same as used for the live site (which kinda makes sense, given that this is to be a preview of it)

[source,yaml]
----
    - name: Install Ruby Dev                     
      run: sudo apt-get install ruby-dev

    - name: Install AsciiDoctor and Rouge
      run: sudo gem install asciidoctor rouge

    - name: Setup Hugo                           
      uses: peaceiris/actions-hugo@v2
      with:
        hugo-version: '0.85.0'
----

=== Determining the preview URL

To deploy to `surge.sh` I used the same GitHub Action as Gunnar, which is https://github.com/afc163/surge-preview[this one]. The URL that it deploys to is determined by the source repository and PR number: 

> `https://{{repository.owner}}-{{repository.name}}-{{job.name}}-pr-{{pr.number}}.surge.sh`

These break down as follows: 

* `repository.owner`: `rmoff`
* `repository.name`: `rmoff-blog`
* `job.name`: This is the name of the job, specified under `jobs:` in the YAML that defines the Workflow. 
* `pr.number`: The PR number, which can be obtained from a variable in the workflow. 

I'm stealing https://github.com/gunnarmorling/morling.dev/blob/master/.github/workflows/preview.yml#L17[Gunnar's nice bit of code] here to determine the PR number :) 

[source,yaml]
----
    - name: Setup base URL env var
      run: |
        export PRNUMBER=$(jq --raw-output .pull_request.number "$GITHUB_EVENT_PATH") 
        echo BASEURL="https://rmoff-rmoff-blog-preview-pr-"$PRNUMBER".surge.sh/" >> $GITHUB_ENV
----

Note that `export` works locally to a step, but to pass the variable between steps you append the setting of it to `$GITHUB_ENV`

=== Build the Hugo site

Install of simply `hugo` which builds the site, we add a few command line flags to build draft posts (`--buildDrafts`), future-dated posts (`--buildFuture`), and also change the base URL (`--baseURL`) which by default (per the https://github.com/rmoff/rmoff-blog/blob/master/config.yaml[`config.yaml`]) is the live site (`rmoff.net`). 

Note that if the base URL is incorrectly set the resulting built site won't render properly - you'll get missing CSS files, weird relative links, etc. 

=== Deploying the built site to surge.sh

https://github.com/afc163/surge-preview[This action] deploys the built site (under `/public`, specified in the `dist` parameter) from the previous step to surge.sh: 

[source,yaml]
----
    - name: Preview
      uses: afc163/surge-preview@v1
      id: preview_step
      with:
        surge_token: ${{ secrets.SURGE_TOKEN }}
        github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        dist: public
        failOnError: 'true'
        teardown: true
        build: |
          echo Deploying to surge.sh
----

== The finished workflow

[source,yaml]
----
include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rmoff/rmoff-blog/master/.github/workflows/preview-blog.yaml[]
----

Put this YAML in a file in your github repository root folder under `.github/workflows/`. 

== The workflow in action

1. Create a branch of the master branch, into which you will commit a new blog post
+
[source,bash]
----
git checkout -b my_new_article
----

2. Start writing your blog. Once it's ready to publish as a draft, commit it and push to GitHub: 
+
[source,bash]
----
git add content/post/never_gonna_give_you_up.adoc
git commit -m "Draft ready for review"
git push --set-upstream origin my_new_article
----

3. Create a PR from the new branch
+
image::/images/2022/04/pr1.png[]
+
image::/images/2022/04/pr2.png[]
+
When you create the PR you'll notice that a check has been added to it - this is the Action that's configured by the workflow and triggered by the PR being created
+
image::/images/2022/04/pr2a.png[]

4. As the action runs you'll see it update the PR with its status, and then a completion message including the URL to which the preview has been uploaded
+
image::/images/2022/04/pr4.png[]

5. Bask in the glory of a nice preview of your new article, whilst safely not impinging upon your live site.
