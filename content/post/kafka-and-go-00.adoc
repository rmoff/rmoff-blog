With the first leg of my journey with Go link:/2020/07/03/learning-golang-some-rough-notes-s01e10-concurrency-web-crawler/[done] (starting from a link:/2020/06/25/learning-golang-some-rough-notes-s01e00/[_very_ rudimentary base]), the next step for me was to bring it into my current area of interest and work - Apache Kafka. 

<!--more-->

There are several client libraries available. I'm going to use the https://docs.confluent.io/current/clients/go.html[the Confluent Go client] for now, and if I feel the need later on might explore the others. The https://docs.confluent.io/current/clients/confluent-kafka-go/index.html[API docs] are comprehensive as are the https://github.com/confluentinc/confluent-kafka-go/tree/master/examples[example code snippets] and some showing https://github.com/confluentinc/examples/tree/5.5.1-post/clients/cloud/go[how to use the Go client with Confluent Cloud]. 

Here I'm going to try and apply what I've learnt so far to the Kafka client and build my understanding of it from the ground up (instead of blindly copy & pasting which is effective but less educational than taking something apart and reassembling it ðŸ˜Ž).
