The server sends `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` data, and you want to work with the data *as you get it*, instead of waiting for the server to finish, the EOF to fire, and _then_ process the data? 

<!--more-->

Here's an example `curl` of the kind of session I'm talking about: 

[source,bash]
----
âžœ curl --verbose --location 'http://localhost:8088/query' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/vnd.ksql.v1+json; charset=utf-8' \
--data-raw '{
    "ksql": "SELECT NAME, TS, CAPACITY, EMPTY_PLACES FROM CARPARK_EVENTS  WHERE  EMPTY_PLACES > 100 emit changes;"
}'
*   Trying ::1...
* TCP_NODELAY set
* Connected to localhost (::1) port 8088 (#0)
> POST /query HTTP/1.1
> Host: localhost:8088
> User-Agent: curl/7.64.1
> Accept: */*
> Content-Type: application/vnd.ksql.v1+json; charset=utf-8
> Content-Length: 118
>
* upload completely sent off: 118 out of 118 bytes
< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
< content-type: application/json
< Transfer-Encoding: chunked
<
----

The API that I'm working with sends a complete JSON message, but spread over chunks. It starts with a header

[source,javascript]
----
[{"header":{"queryId":"none","schema":"`NAME` STRING, `TS` BIGINT, `CAPACITY` INTEGER, `EMPTY_PLACES` INTEGER"}},
----

and then at some point - perhaps straight away, perhaps after a few seconds, you get some data

[source,javascript]
----
{"row":{"columns":["Westgate",1595372100000,116,116]}},
{"row":{"columns":["Burnett St",1595372100000,122,117]}},
----

and then some empty rows

[source,bash]
----



----

and then maybe some more data

[source,javascript]
----
{"row":{"columns":["Crown Court",1595372100000,142,130]}},
{"row":{"columns":["Leisure Exchange",1595372100000,996,976]}},
----


This is from a https://ksqldb.io[streaming database], and the idea is that the client can use the data as it's continually sent. Contrast this to the standard request-response pattern of data consumption in which the request is fully satisfied before the client will process the response. 

From my Googling I came across two standard patterns for consuming JSON from a REST call:

* `NewDecoder`
+
[source,go]
----
json.NewDecoder(resp.Body).Decode(&m)
----

* `Unmarshal`
+
[source,go]
----
json.Unmarshal(resp.Body, &m)
----

But I found that both of these *blocked* until the entire response had been received - which is not what I wanted. https://stackoverflow.com/a/22177737/350613[Courtesy of `chourobin`] I found this solution. First up, create the client and request: 

[source,go]
----
// Prepare the request
url := "http://localhost:8088/query"
method := "POST"
k := "SELECT NAME, TS, CAPACITY, EMPTY_PLACES FROM CARPARK_EVENTS  WHERE  EMPTY_PLACES > " + strconv.Itoa(c) + "  EMIT CHANGES;"
payload := strings.NewReader("{\"ksql\":\"" + k + "\"}")

// Create the client
client := &http.Client{}
req, err := http.NewRequest(method, url, payload)
if err != nil {
    return err
}
req.Header.Add("Content-Type", "application/vnd.ksql.v1+json; charset=utf-8")

// Make the request
res, err := client.Do(req)
if err != nil {
    return err
}
defer res.Body.Close()
----

Now create a `NewReader` to consume the response:

[source,go]
----
reader := bufio.NewReader(res.Body)
----

And then run a loop which consumes the response a line at a time: 

[source,go]
----
doThis := true
for doThis {
    // Read the next chunk
    lb, err := reader.ReadBytes('\n')
    if err != nil {
        // Got an error back (e.g. EOF), so exit the loop
        doThis = false
    } else {
        // Do stuff with the response here
        fmt.Printf("\nGot some data:\n\t%v", string(lb))
    }
}    
----

== What about the JSON? 

If you notice the example response shown above, the chunks are not self-contained JSON. 

* The header chunk opens an array: 
+
[source,javascript]
----
[{"header":{"queryId":"none","schema":"`NAME` STRING, `TS` BIGINT, `CAPACITY` INTEGER, `EMPTY_PLACES` INTEGER"}},
----

* Each row chunk is an array entry with trailing comma
+
[source,javascript]
----
{"row":{"columns":["Westgate",1595372100000,116,116]}},
----

The inbound stream of Bytes is split into lines using `reader.ReadBytes('\n')`. This function takes a single byte as the token by which to split, but instead of splitting on `\n` (ASCII 13) alone, we actually want to split on `,\r\n` (ASCII 44, 10, 13) since we have the trailing comma to remove, and the CRLF as the delineator. 

Now, I *think* the proper option here is to use a https://golang.org/pkg/bufio/#Scanner[`Scanner`] but for a quick win I instead did a dirty thing and just truncated slice by two bytes ðŸ¤¢  (the first byte being `\n` which had already been removed by the `ReadBytes` function)

[source,go]
----
if len(lb) > 2 {
    lb = lb[:len(lb)-2]
----

You can then take the slice of bytes and marshall the JSON into a Go variable. You need to declare this first, using a custom typeâ€”defining the type is easy using https://mholt.github.io/json-to-go/[this handy little tool], into which you paste some sample JSON and it spits out the Go type defintion: 

image::/images/2020/07/jsontogo.png[]

So taking this Go code: 

[source,go]
----
type ksqlDBMessageRow struct {
	Row struct {
		Columns []interface{} `json:"columns"`
	} `json:"row"`
}
----

you declare the variable into which you'll store the row that's been read: 

[source,go]
----
var r ksqlDBMessageRow

// â€¦

if strings.Contains(string(lb), "row") {
    // Looks like a Row, let's process it!
    err = json.Unmarshal(lb, &r)
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Printf("Error decoding JSON %v (%v)\n", string(lb), err)
    }
}
----

From that you can then access the actual values in the payload itself: 

[source,go]
----
if r.Row.Columns != nil {
    CARPARK = r.Row.Columns[0].(string)
    DATA_TS = r.Row.Columns[1].(float64)
    CURRENT_EMPTY_PLACES = r.Row.Columns[2].(float64)
    CAPACITY = r.Row.Columns[3].(float64)
    // Handle the timestamp
    t := int64(DATA_TS)
    ts := time.Unix(t/1000, 0)
    fmt.Printf("Carpark %v at %v has %v spaces available (capacity %v)\n", CARPARK, ts, CURRENT_EMPTY_PLACES, CAPACITY)
}
----
