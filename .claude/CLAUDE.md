# Blog Project Instructions

## Proofreading

When asked to proofread or review a blog post:
- Use `/proofread-blog` for regular articles
- Use `/proofread-links` for "Interesting Links" posts (files matching `il-*.adoc` or posts mentioning "Interesting Links")
  - Switch to Haiku first for cost efficiency: `/model haiku`
